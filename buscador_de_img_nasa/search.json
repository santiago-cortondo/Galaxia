Operated from 2009 to 2013, Herschel detected wavelengths of light in the far-infrared and microwave ranges, and was ideal for studying dust in nearby galaxies because it could capture small-scale structures in the dust clouds in high resolution. However, Herschel often couldn't detect light from diffuse dust clouds – especially in the outer regions of galaxies, where the gas and dust become sparse and thus fainter. As a result, the mission missed up to 30% of all the light given off by dust. Combining the Herschel observations with data from other observatories creates a more complete picture of the dust in the galaxy.      In the image, red indicates hydrogen gas; green indicates cold dust; and warmer dust is shown in blue. Launched in 1983, IRAS was the first space telescope to detect infrared light, setting the stage for future observatories like NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. The Planck observatory, launched in 2009, and COBE, launched in 1989, both studied the cosmic microwave background, or light left over from the big bang.      Red indicates hydrogen gas detected using the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope in the Netherlands, and the Institute for Radio Astronomy in the Millimeter Range 30-meter telescope in Spain.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA25163","description_508":"The Andromeda galaxy, or M31, is shown here in far-infrared and radio wavelengths of light.","keywords":["Herschel Space Observatory","Andromeda Galaxy"],"media_type":"image","nasa_id":"PIA25163","secondary_creator":"ESA/NASA/JPL-Caltech/GBT/WSRT/IRAM/C.

The largest NASA Hubble Space Telescope image ever assembled, this sweeping view of a portion of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) is the sharpest large composite image ever taken of our galactic neighbor. Though the galaxy is over 2 million light-years away, the Hubble telescope is powerful enough to resolve individual stars in a 61,000-light-year-long section of the galaxy's pancake-shaped disk.

And, there are lots of stars in this sweeping view — over 100 million, with some of them in thousands of star clusters seen embedded in the disk. This ambitious photographic cartography of the Andromeda galaxy represents a new benchmark for precision studies of large spiral galaxies which dominate the universe's population of over 100 billion galaxies.

Though the galaxy is over 2 million light-years away, The Hubble Space Telescope is powerful enough to resolve individual stars in a 61,000-light-year-long stretch of the galaxy’s pancake-shaped disk. It's like photographing a beach and resolving individual grains of sand. And there are lots of stars in this sweeping view -- over 100 million, with some of them in thousands of star clusters seen embedded in the disk.  This ambitious photographic cartography of the Andromeda galaxy represents a new benchmark for precision studies of large spiral galaxies that dominate the universe's population of over 100 billion galaxies. Never before have astronomers been able to see individual stars inside an external spiral galaxy over such a large contiguous area. Most of the stars in the universe live inside such majestic star cities, and this is the first data that reveal populations of stars in context to their home galaxy. Hubble traces densely packed stars extending from the innermost hub of the galaxy seen at the left. Moving out from this central galactic bulge, the panorama sweeps from the galaxy's central bulge across lanes of stars and dust to the sparser outer disk. Large groups of young blue stars indicate the locations of star clusters and star-forming regions. The stars bunch up in the blue ring-like feature toward the right side of the image. The dark silhouettes trace out complex dust structures. Underlying the entire galaxy is a smooth distribution of cooler red stars that trace Andromeda’s evolution over billions of years.  Because the galaxy is only 2.5 million light-years from Earth, it is a much bigger target in the sky than the myriad galaxies Hubble routinely photographs that are billions of light-years away. This means that the Hubble survey is assembled together into a mosaic image using 7,398 exposures taken over 411 individual pointings.

The x-rays are produced by matter furneling toward the black hole. Numerous other hotter x-ray sources are also apparent. Most of these are probably due to x-ray binary systems, in which a neutron star or black hole is in close orbit around a normal star. While the gas falling into the central black hole is cool, it is only cool by comparison to the 100 other x-ray sources in the Andromeda Galaxy. To be detected by an x-ray telescope, the gas must have a temperature of more than a million degrees. The Andromeda Galaxy is our nearest neighbor spiral galaxy at a distance of two million light years.

As this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image shows, NGC 2500 is a particular kind of spiral galaxy known as a barred spiral, its wispy arms swirling out from a bright, elongated core.  Barred spirals are actually more common than was once thought. Around two-thirds of all spiral galaxies — including the Milky Way — exhibit these straight bars cutting through their centers. These cosmic structures act as glowing nurseries for newborn stars, and funnel material towards the active core of a galaxy. NGC 2500 is still actively forming new stars, although this process appears to be occurring very unevenly. The upper half of the galaxy — where the spiral arms are slightly better defined — hosts many more star-forming regions than the lower half, as indicated by the bright, dotted islands of light.  There is another similarity between NGC 2500 and our home galaxy. Together with Andromeda, Triangulum and many smaller natural satellites, the Milky Way is part of the Local Group of galaxies, a gathering of over 50 galaxies all loosely held together by gravity. NGC 2500 forms a similar group with some of its nearby neighbors, including NGC 2541, NGC 2552, NGC 2537 and the bright, Andromeda-like spiral NGC 2481 (known collectively as the NGC 2841 group).

UGC 477 is a low surface brightness (LSB) galaxy. First proposed in 1976 by Mike Disney, the existence of LSB galaxies was confirmed only in 1986 with the discovery of Malin 1. LSB galaxies like UGC 477 are more diffusely distributed than galaxies such as Andromeda and the Milky Way. With surface brightnesses up to 250 times fainter than the night sky, these galaxies can be incredibly difficult to detect.  Most of the matter present in LSB galaxies is in the form of hydrogen gas, rather than stars. Unlike the bulges of normal spiral galaxies, the centres of LSB galaxies do not contain large numbers of stars. Astronomers suspect that this is because LSB galaxies are mainly found in regions devoid of other galaxies, and have therefore experienced fewer galactic interactions and mergers capable of triggering high rates of star formation. LSB galaxies such as UGC 477 instead appear to be dominated by dark matter, making them excellent objects to study to further our understanding of this elusive substance. However, due to an underrepresentation in galactic surveys — caused by their characteristic low brightness — their importance has only been realised relatively recently."}],"links":[{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/hubble-sees-galaxy-hiding-in-the-night-sky_26774948406_o/hubble-sees-galaxy-hiding-in-the-night-sky_26774948406_o~thumb.jpg","rel":"preview","render":"image"}]},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/hubble-uncovers-a-mysterious-hermit_27482883442_o/collection.json","data":[{"center":"GSFC","title":"A mysterious hermit","keywords":["UGC 4879"],"nasa_id":"hubble-uncovers-a-mysterious-hermit_27482883442_o","date_created":"2016-06-06T00:00:00Z","media_type":"image","description":"The drizzle of stars scattered across this image forms a galaxy known as UGC 4879.

Sensitive to invisible x-ray light, Chandra can see the heat given off by massive stellar objects regardless of their distance.  This ability to peer into the overwhelming darkness of space has revealed a hidden thermal universe previously veiled by the dominance of visible light.  From the dark depths of space, Chandra has significantly elevated our understanding of black holes.  Known for their ability to engulf everything around them, today we can measure a black hole's speed of spin, the limits of their gravitational influence and how many there are.  Chandra has also been a window into galactic evolution.  From its vantage view in space, the telescope observed a violent collision of the Antennae galaxies.  Galactic collisions could promote the formation of new stars and planets, and be in our own distant future as the Milky Way slowly drifts toward the Andromeda Galaxy.    Half a decade later, Chandra has once again returned to origins to take another look at Cassiopeia A.   The supernova remnant is a former star, having cast of its gaseous layer in a violent explosion.  At 200 times the resolution of the original 'first light' photos, the new images of Cassiopeia A reveal a torrent of clouds and molecular jets surrounding the object.   On only its fifth birthday, the Chandra X-ray Observatory is celebrating a long list of discoveries that have forever changed how we see the universe."}],"links":[{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/video/ksc_082604_chandra/ksc_082604_chandra~thumb.jpg","rel":"preview","render":"image"},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/video/ksc_082604_chandra/ksc_082604_chandra.vtt","rel":"captions"}]},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203049/collection.json","data":[{"center":"MSFC","title":"Space Science","keywords":["Hubble Space Telescope","NGC 4676","The Mice"],"nasa_id":"0203049","date_created":"2002-04-07T00:00:00Z","media_type":"image","description":"The Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), the newest camera on the Hubble Space Telescope, has captured a spectacular pair of galaxies. Located 300 million light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices, the colliding galaxies have been nicknamed \"The Mice\" because of the long tails of stars and gas emanating from each galaxy. Otherwise known as NGC 4676, the pair will eventually merge into a single giant galaxy. In the galaxy at left, the bright blue patch is resolved into a vigorous cascade of clusters and associations of young, hot blue stars, whose formation has been triggered by the tidal forces of the gravitational interaction. The clumps of young stars in the long, straight tidal tail (upper right) are separated by fainter regions of material. These dim regions suggest that the clumps of stars have formed from the gravitational collapse of the gas and dust that once occupied those areas. Some of the clumps have luminous masses comparable to dwarf galaxies that orbit the halo of our own Milky Way Galaxy. Computer simulations by astronomers show that we are seeing two near identical spiral galaxies approximately 160 million years after their closest encounter. The simulations also show that the pair will eventually merge, forming a large, nearly spherical galaxy (known as an elliptical galaxy). The Mice presage what may happen to our own Milky Way several billion years from now when it collides with our nearest large neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31).

The scale bar is in astronomical units, with each set distance beyond 1 AU representing 10 times the previous distance. One AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth, which is about 93 million miles, or 150 million kilometers. Neptune, the most distant planet from the Sun, is about 30 AU.  Much of the solar system is actually in interstellar space. Informally, the term \"solar system\" is often used to mean the space out to the last planet. Scientific consensus, however, says the solar system goes out to the Oort Cloud, the source of the comets that swing by our sun on long time scales. Beyond the outer edge of the Oort Cloud, the gravity of other stars begins to dominate that of the Sun.  The inner edge of the main part of the Oort Cloud could be as close as 1,000 AU from our Sun. The outer edge is estimated to be around 100,000 AU.  Voyager 2, the second farthest human-made object after Voyager 1, is around 119 AU from the Sun. Indications from the scientific instruments suggest Voyager 2 passed beyond our heliosphere (the bubble of plasma the Sun blows around itself) and into interstellar space (the space between stars) in November 2018. The heliosphere has a turbulent outer boundary known as the heliosheath. The termination shock is the inner boundary of the heliosheath and the heliopause is the outer boundary, beyond which lies interstellar space. Voyager 2 crossed the termination shock at 84 AU in August 2007.  It will take about 300 years for Voyager 2 to reach the inner edge of the Oort Cloud and possibly about 30,000 years to fly beyond it.  Voyager 2 is heading away from the Sun about 36 degrees out of the ecliptic plane (plane of the planets) to the south, toward the constellations of Sagittarius and Pavo. In about 40,000 years, Voyager 2 will be closer to another star than our own Sun, coming within about 1.7 light years of a star called Ross 248, a small star in the constellation of Andromeda.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22921"}],"links":[{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA22921/PIA22921~thumb.jpg","rel":"preview","render":"image"}]},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GSFC_20171208_Archive_e001792/collection.json","data":[{"album":["Test"],"center":"GSFC","title":"Rare Ultra-blue Stars Found in Neighboring Galaxy's Hub","keywords":["Rare Ultra-blue Stars Found in Neighboring Galaxy's Hub","stars","nasa","galaxy","blackhole","goddard","hubble","milkyway","billions","lastfrontier"],"location":"Greenbelt, MD","nasa_id":"GSFC_20171208_Archive_e001792","date_created":"2017-12-08T00:00:00Z","media_type":"image","description":"Image release January 11, 2012  A new Hubble Space Telescope image centers on the 100-million-solar-mass black hole at the hub of the neighboring spiral galaxy M31, or the Andromeda galaxy, one of the few galaxies outside the Milky Way visible to the naked eye and the only other giant galaxy in the Local Group.

Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) instruments observed the galaxy from a distance of 500 million light-years.  This particular object stands out from the crowd by actually being composed of two separate galaxies rushing past each other at about 2 million kilometers (1,243,000 miles) per hour. This speed is most likely too fast for them to merge and form a single galaxy. However, because of their small separation of only about 20,000 light-years, the galaxies will distort one another through the force of gravity while passing each other, changing their structures on a grand scale.  Such galactic interactions are a common sight for Hubble, and have long been a field of study for astronomers. The intriguing behaviors of interacting galaxies take many forms; galactic cannibalism, galaxy harassment and even galaxy collisions. The Milky Way itself will eventually fall victim to the latter, merging with the Andromeda Galaxy in about 4.5 billion years. The fate of our galaxy shouldn’t be alarming though: while galaxies are populated by billions of stars, the distances between individual stars are so large that hardly any stellar collisions will occur.

Here we see two spiral galaxies engaged in a cosmic tug-of-war — but in this contest, there will be no winner. The structures of both objects are slowly distorted to resemble new forms, and in some cases, merge together to form new, super galaxies. This particular fate is similar to that of the Milky Way Galaxy, when it will ultimately merge with our closest galactic partner, the Andromeda Galaxy. There is no need to panic however, as this process takes several hundreds of millions of years.  Not all interacting galaxies result in mergers though. The merger is dependent on the mass of each galaxy, as well as the relative velocities of each body. It is quite possible that the event pictured here, romantically named 2MASX J06094582-2140234, will avoid a merger event altogether, and will merely distort the arms of each spiral without colliding — the cosmic equivalent of a hair ruffling!  These galactic interactions also trigger new regions of star formation in the galaxies involved, causing them to be extremely luminous in the infrared part of the spectrum. For this reason, these types of galaxies are referred to as LIRGs, or Luminous Infrared Galaxies. This image was taken as part of as part of a Hubble survey of the central regions of LIRGs in the local Universe, which also used the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instrument.

Data from NASA's Spitzer and Hubble space telescopes have been combined to show these dramatic galaxies in light that spans the visible and infrared parts of the spectrum.  This dramatic pairing shows two galaxies that couldn't look more different as their mutual gravitational attraction slowly drags them closer together.  The \"penguin\" part of the pair, NGC 2336, was probably once a relatively normal-looking spiral galaxy, flattened like a pancake with smoothly symmetric spiral arms. Rich with newly-formed hot stars, seen in visible light from Hubble as bluish filaments, its shape has now been twisted and distorted as it responds to the gravitational tugs of its neighbor. Strands of gas mixed with dust stand out as red filaments detected at longer wavelengths of infrared light seen by Spitzer.  The \"egg\" of the pair, NGC 2937, by contrast, is nearly featureless. The distinctly different greenish glow of starlight tells the story of a population of much older stars. The absence of glowing red dust features informs us that it has long since lost its reservoir of gas and dust from which new stars can form. While this galaxy is certainly reacting to the presence of its neighbor, its smooth distribution of stars obscures any obvious distortions of its shape.  Eventually these two galaxies will merge to form a single object, with their two populations of stars, gas and dust intermingling. This kind of merger was likely a significant step in the history of most large galaxies we see around us in the nearby universe, including our own Milky Way.  At a distance of about 23 million light-years, these two galaxies are roughly 10 times farther away than our nearest major galactic neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. The blue streak at the top of the image is an unrelated background galaxy that is farther away than Arp 142.  Combining light from across the visible and infrared spectrums helps astronomers piece together the complex story of the life cycles of galaxies. While this image required data from both the Spitzer and Hubble telescopes to cover this range of light, NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope will be able to see all of these wavelengths of light, and with dramatically better clarity.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22092"}],"links":[{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA22092/PIA22092~thumb.jpg","rel":"preview","render":"image"}]},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GSFC_20171208_Archive_e000362/collection.json","data":[{"album":["Test"],"center":"GSFC","title":"Hubble Sees Galaxy Hiding in the Night Sky","keywords":["Hubble Sees Galaxy Hiding in the Night Sky","space","nasa","galaxy","hubble","hubblespacetelescope","nasagoddard","ugc477"],"location":"Greenbelt, MD","nasa_id":"GSFC_20171208_Archive_e000362","date_created":"2017-12-08T00:00:00Z","media_type":"image","description":"This striking NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image captures the galaxy UGC 477, located just over 110 million light-years away in the constellation of Pisces (The Fish).  UGC 477 is a low surface brightness (LSB) galaxy. First proposed in 1976 by Mike Disney, the existence of LSB galaxies was confirmed only in 1986 with the discovery of Malin 1. LSB galaxies like UGC 477 are more diffusely distributed than galaxies such as Andromeda and the Milky Way. With surface brightnesses up to 250 times fainter than the night sky, these galaxies can be incredibly difficult to detect.  Most of the matter present in LSB galaxies is in the form of hydrogen gas, rather than stars. Unlike the bulges of normal spiral galaxies, the centers of LSB galaxies do not contain large numbers of stars. Astronomers suspect that this is because LSB galaxies are mainly found in regions devoid of other galaxies, and have therefore experienced fewer galactic interactions and mergers capable of triggering high rates of star formation.  LSB galaxies such as UGC 477 instead appear to be dominated by dark matter, making them excellent objects to study to further our understanding of this elusive substance. However, due to an underrepresentation in galactic surveys — caused by their characteristic low brightness — their importance has only been realized relatively recently.

Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. Episode 101, \"Lesser Known Stories of Apollo 11.\" I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. If you're familiar with us, this is where we bringing scientists, engineers, astronauts, historians, all to let you know the coolest stuff about what's going on right here at NASA. And sometimes we take a moment to reflect on what we've done in the past. Chances are you, at the very least, know the highlights of Apollo 11--  Neil Armstrong: Houston, Tranquility Base here. The eagle has landed.  Charlie Duke: Roger Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.  Walter Cronkite Armstrong is on the moon. Neil Armstrong, 38 year old American, standing on the surface of the moon on this July 20th, 1969.  Neil Armstrong: It's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.  Host: It was a harrowing journey to get there but NASA persevered and got the job done by the end of the decade. They did it-- Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin-- took the first steps on the lunar surface. You can probably look anywhere-- books, documentaries, movies, articles-- and really dive deep into that mission normally told by recognizable figures-- Armstrong and Aldrin, Mike Collins, Gene Kranz. What you might not have heard are the stories of people working on the space shuttle before the moon landing even happened, monitoring the lunar space walk from the back rooms of Mission Control. And the recovery operations after landing. The arrival of the moon rocks at the Johnson Space Center. Stories of the many others who were helping to make this mission successful but that you may not have heard before. To recount stories behind the scenes of that historic mission we're bringing in some very special guests. Returning to the podcast once again is Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, our historian here at the Johnson Space Center. She's worked on oral history projects here interviewing many people to capture the lesser known stories, so she's coming on the podcast today to talk about some of these great adventures. We also shot a video a few months ago at Rice Stadium. We had such a great turnout for this video and it turned out to be partially a reunion for the nearly 50 Apollo alumni that excitedly agreed to participate. And while we were there, we tag teamed with Rice University to film as many Apollo alumni as we could in a short amount of time for them to tell their stories and we'll share those here today. So starting with Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, here are some of the lesser known stories of Apollo 11 told 50 years after the historic landing on the moon. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Once again, you are among the elite here coming on three times so I really appreciate all of the time you've dedicated to us.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Oh well thank you so much for inviting me. It's an honor.  Host: And it's been 50 years now since the landing of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon. And of all the topics, you know we've thought about this for a while, what do we really want to explore to celebrate the Apollo 50th because NASA is doing a lot all across the agency, so what can we do here on the podcast? And I thought this was such a unique topic to explore. The lesser known stories of Apollo 11. Things that-- you might hear the recognizable story, one small step for man-- you know you might hear that a lot of times but I think this is a great medium to explore some of the other ones. So Jennifer, you've put together really a fantastic list of stories that go from even before the moon landing, through the moon landing, 'til after the-- I think we're going to end with one of, I think my favorites, after going over this so I'm really looking forward to it. I think I want to kick off though, let's talk about, you know, what do we have in store actually before we even go into that? What do we even have in store for us today?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, as you mentioned I tried to pull together some of the unknown stories of Apollo 11. We all know the Gene Kranz story, the lunar landing mission and his talk before the MOCR crew, and you know he's with them 100% whether we land or we don't, I'm with you. And we know a lot of what was going on with the crew. We don't know a lot of the stories though about the people behind the scenes and so I tried to pull together some of those stories. And also, like you mentioned, pull together a story pre-mission and then some of the things that were going on during the mission that aren't, weren't as notable but today I think are quite interesting. They're sort of human stories that I think people will engage with. And then the post flight, what was going on like in the LRL and the mobile quarantine facility.  Host: That's awesome. Yeah so some of these names you're going to be hearing today are names you may have never heard before. I do think though you do have one name that I'm pretty familiar with, Michael Collins.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes. [laughs]  Host: [Laughs] Of course he was the one, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, we always say those names right up front because they were the ones that had the boots on the moon, but someone had to be in the command module up orbiting the moon. And guess who that was? It was Michael Collins.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: So what did-- let's see, he might have a little lesser known story I suppose.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know he does, and it's something, I was flipping through \"Carrying the Fire\" which is his autobiography, and I was just looking for stories and I came across a poem that his wife wrote to him before his mission. He actually took the day off before the flight which we always think the astronauts are working madly up until their mission and once they climb into the cabin they're kind of done but he decided to take the day off and he called his wife-- his wife was not there-- and had a chat with her and kept rereading her note to him and the poem that was attached to it. So I thought maybe your readers would like to hear this poem that she wrote to him.  Host: Oh that is wonderful, yes. Let's go through that poem.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Okay. So this is called \"To a Husband Who Must Seek the Stars.\"   In your eyes, the first glad token  As when first our love we proved,  So your mind to mine has spoken  Just as if you're lips had moved.   You are saying -- yes I know --  That the lure of space beguiles.  You are pleading, “Let me go,”  Not unwilling but with smiles.   Can you love me, and still choose  Whispers that I cannot hear?  Late to love, how can I bear to lose? Content for some inconstant sphere?   Tell me how you see my role- To stay, to wait, yet yearn to go.  Where is the comfort for my soul?  You, my love, have helped me know.   I'll be unafraid, undaunted.  Yes of course! I need not face Any peril; or be haunted By the hazards you embrace.   I could've sought by wit or wile  Your bright dream to dim. And yet  If I'd swayed you with a smile My reward would be regret.   So, for once, you shall not hear  Of the tears unbidden, welling;  Or the nighttime stabs of fear.  These, this time, are not for telling.   Take my silence though intended;  Fill it with the joy you feel.  Take my courage, now pretended-- You my love will make it real.   And he wrote in his book, I hope I will.  Host: Wow. So that was, I guess it was her way of saying you know you need to do this mission, don't worry about me. You know I'm not going to stop you. This is kind of your destiny almost.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah and to me it's, she's also telling him while she might be scared she's not going to share those feelings with him.  Host: Yes.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: She wants him to have this opportunity. She doesn't want him to have any regrets or herself to have any regrets.  Host: But she was open with that emotion to him even-- because you said this was even before his mission.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: It was.  Host: She said know that I am scared but it's not going to stop you, it's not going to stop me from stopping you. And even if I did, I would regret it.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah.  Host: Wow. What a beautiful way to say that. And you said that Michael Collins was on the phone with her reading back her poem to him on the phone?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well no I think he was rereading it in crew quarters.  Host: He was rereading it in crew quarters?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah and--  Host: I see.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know he mentioned how clearly she had been thinking about this for some time. It wasn't just a note, you know, kind of I love you, good luck on the mission. Clearly she had thought about this for some time and been working on it.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: What all did Michael Collins do on his day off before his mission, do you know?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know, what else he did, I don't know. [laughs] He just mentioned that which I thought was interesting.  Host: He just-- yeah. That was probably one of the more significant things. If you're going to remember anything, that's a beautiful thing to remember.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: All right Jennifer, I'm really excited to go into these stories. To sort of kick things off though these stories are from something that your office does and the Oral History Project. Tell me a little bit about that.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so we have a major oral history project at our center. We're sort of the lead center for oral histories across the agency. And our project was established by Center Director George Abbey in 1996. And if you're interested in more of the history you can actually go out and read an interview with Duane Ross who sort of helped kick off the project. But I'll give you a little bit of history. Mr. Abbey was a big fan of Stephen Ambrose. He wrote a number of books that were quite popular in the 90's like \"D-Day\". He wrote about Lewis and Clark and some other folks. And so he was a big fan of his efforts at interviewing these veterans and he realized that we were losing a lot of folks here at JSC who took part in the Apollo Program, Mercury, Gemini, and he wanted to capture those experiences. He wanted to capture the procedures and processes but also the events and the career experiences of some of these individuals or lessons learned. And so that project kicked off in 1997. The first interview was with Jack Kinzler who we'll be talking a little bit about today as well, and you know he was well known at the center for being a Mr. Fix It and saving Skylab, and but he was our first in the summer of 1997. Since then we have interviewed 982 people.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: We have over 2,000 recorded hours of oral history. We've done over 1,200 sessions and we have over 1,000 transcripts online.  Host: Whew! It's got to be difficult to remember all those stories. That's why you've got to capture them, right? [Laughs]  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes, exactly. And everybody's got a story.  Host: Yeah, and they span-- this is not just Apollo history right? They span through the-- is it the agency's history? Is it Johnson Space Center's history?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well we actually do a lot of different oral history projects. So interesting that you mention that. We do our JSC Oral History project and it does span from the Space Task Group days through International Space Station, Orion. We've tried to capture all of that history and everything in between. But we do do oral histories for NASA headquarters. So we do interviews with administrators or center directors, people that our headquarters history office wants us to talk to. And then we've done different projects over the years that we've received funding for. Like for instance when the shuttle was retiring we did a big project to capture the history of the space shuttle from development through retirement which was a huge effort. Can you imagine, you know, 40 years of history--  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: in oral histories?  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: 30 years of shuttle but you're talking about development stage right?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Yeah and there's a lot of years there.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah there's a lot going on. So we've got that. We've captured some history of aviatrix. Let's see, we've captured a lot of women's history with the Herstory's project. So there's quite a bit out there if people want to go out to the JSC history portal and look at the oral histories, there's just so much material out there. It's such a wealth of material from these people that we've interviewed.  Host: Very exciting. And today we're going to be focusing on mainly the time around Apollo. And I think when we were going through these stories together, I think you kicked it off in such a nice way because the first thing we're actually going to talk about is the space shuttle which a lot of people don't even recognize was a thing around the time of Apollo 11. So this one was with Jerry Ross and Kathy Sullivan.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so Jerry Ross, he's very well known for the number of space flights that he flew on. He's actually the record holder of seven space flights along with Franklin Chang-Diaz. And Kathy Sullivan was one of the first six women astronauts selected 1978 and she's the first American woman to do a space walk. So, you know, very well known folks. I picked these stories because I just thought they were interesting. I thought it was important to highlight the fact that there were people who were going to be working in the program later in life who were witnessing and remembered these and shared these memories with us. So Jerry Ross, he remembers, he was in college at that point. Since fourth grade he wanted to be an engineer and go to Purdue. And so this was summer break and he was working for U.S. Steel. And he remembers just sitting on his couch with his fiancée on his lap just waiting for that first spacewalk to happen on the moon, and being very excited about it. He also remembers his younger sister taking snapshots of the television. And you know it was pretty grainy, kind of hard to see, and he kept telling her you know those shots aren't going to turn out but they ended up turning out. But he was just, you know, mesmerized, he said by the whole mission itself. His fiancée found him just sort of sitting there watching, you know, endless footage of Mission Control and what was happening. And then Kathy Sullivan I think is sort of interesting because she really didn't intend initially to study science or, you know, work for NASA. She wasn't going to be an engineer. She had an interest in language and so she was actually going to study languages in college. But she remembers she was 17 at the time sitting in her family den-- you know I can kind of see her sitting on the floor the way most kids do watching TV-- and she remembers she wasn't really a spectator for this event, she was almost like a part of it she said. It just sort of drew her in and she remembers hearing Buzz Aldrin, although she admits she wasn't sure who it was at the time because she really wasn't following that closely, say contact light. And she said you know there was just this sort of spark in her mind like oh, she made a connection as to what was happening here. They had something that she called curb feelers on the lunar module so they could tell where they were on the moon. And she said it just sort of made an imprint on her that, you know, she kind of figured out some of the engineering going on there with the Apollo Program.  Host: Wow, it sounds like such a subtle thing but even these shuttle astronauts were inspired by some of the early parts of NASA history. Actually we're going through right now and interviewing some of our leaders here at the Johnson Space Center talking about, you know, how were you inspired to come here and did Apollo 11 have a significant impact, and all of them-- not all of them but a lot of them-- remember very vividly what they were doing. And a lot of them, you know, they were, a lot of them were kids so they went out and they got like some kind of moon thing that was at the grocery store or the convenience store but it was just fascinating what-- you know how much this inspired people. Now speaking of space shuttle and this is kind of what I think I alluded to in the-- before you even started with the Jerry Ross and Kathy Sullivan story, but space shuttle was a thing even before Apollo 11 landed.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes. Yeah. So I was going through some of our stories and I wanted to make sure we included some women because during the Apollo Program there weren't a lot of women working or at least most of the women were secretaries and admins and we haven't had a chance to talk with them but we've interviewed Ivy Hooks and Dottie Lee and they were some engineers working in the engineering directorate. And Ivy Hooks likes to tell the story how on April 1st-- April Fool's Day 1969-- so we haven't landed on the moon yet, she gets a phone call from Max Faget's secretary and tells her to report to building 36, they're going to have a meeting there and they all thought it was kind of an April Fool's Day joke. And so they show up there and she's like what's going on? You know it's the third floor. There's a lot of furniture in this space. This space hasn't been used. It's kind of dirty, I'm wearing white. Max Faget walks in and Dottie Lee also remembers this-- she was an actual engineer trained by Max Faget-- she originally started out as a human computer out at NACA in Langley. And they both remember him pulling out of this garment bag a space shuttle, a balsa wood plane, and throwing it across the room and saying we're going to build America's next spacecraft. It's going to launch like a rocket and land like a plane. And so these two women-- they were the only two women other than the secretary-- were in this space, they were locked up. They couldn't actually tell anybody where they were or what they were working on or what they were doing, and they were helping to design the first reusable spacecraft, the space shuttle. And there weren't any windows. You know it was kind of a big deal for Ivy. [laughs] But what I find interesting about this is we're working on the next spacecraft while we're still working to land a man on the moon. And interestingly enough, Dottie Lee remembers that because she was in that room and had told herself, she had promised herself when we got back from Apollo 11 she was just going to celebrate. She was going to, you know, party like everyone else. Everyone else was so excited and she remembers she worked late that night.  Host: Oh.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And she was in her car. And her husband also worked out here, John Lee, he was also an engineer. And she was driving home on NASA Road 1. She lived in Dickinson and she remembers seeing cars everywhere. Everyone's at the bars. Everyone's celebrating and she couldn't. She had to drive home and relieve her babysitter so it was kind of, you know, a sad moment I think for her because she had helped accomplish this goal but she had other important things to do. She had two daughters at home--  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: and but she said you know it was exciting for her though because she felt like she was contributing to tomorrow today by working on the space shuttle.  Host: That's right. And it made a significant impact. We already said, you know, like there's 30 years of the shuttle flying and even before that development stage starting in April when Max Faget pulled out a small space shuttle and said this is what we're going to do now.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Um hum. Absolutely.  Host: Who was Max Faget by the way?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Max Faget was our spacecraft designer here at the Johnson Space Center and so he helped design the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo capsule. So he's very well respected.  Host: A good salesman too if he's doing this--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: to get everyone to start working. That's great. [laughs]  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah. And I should add that Dottie Lee actually is known for helping design the nose of the space shuttle. It's called Dottie's nose.  Host: Really?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Okay. The space shuttle, I guess, well was it the space shuttle as we know it or was it--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Really?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Wow, that's a big deal.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: It is a big deal, yeah.  Host: Very busy people I'm sure all across. I know everyone was working real hard on this and that includes, you know, you said Ivy Hooks, she wanted to celebrate and was working late but she also was a mom and that was part of it, relieving the kids.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah Dottie. Dottie was.  Host: Yeah. Oh Dottie, it was Dottie that did it. Oh I'm sorry.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah that's okay. Yeah Ivy doesn't have any children that I'm aware of. [laughs] Don't worry about it.  Host: I messed that up, sorry.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: That's okay.  Host: You know now we're getting into, you know, the actual moon landing. I like this story from Bob Carlton with the stopwatch. That is a great story.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah so Bob Carlton was LEM control. He's working in the mission operations control room and he's on the white team which is Gene Kranz's team. So some people might know this story but I think it's just a great human story because I think they probably know about the challenges that the flight controllers were facing in the room but there's another aspect to it that I'll talk about. So before the mission happened he was, you know they would simulate these missions, they would make sure that everything was running properly, and in his oral history he talks about the fact that they had plenty of margins in the lunar module tanks when they were going to be coming down. They were going to have plenty of fuel to land on the moon. They would have plenty of fuel left. But when they were landing Apollo 11 something happened. Neil Armstrong as he's landing the lunar module sees a huge crater where they're supposed to land and there's boulders. And so suddenly that margin that they had really starts to go down pretty quickly. And so they're watching things. He's watching it. And they weren't supposed to trip something that they called low level inside of the lunar module. They had two ways of telling how much fuel they had. They had something like a gas gauge that would tell them, you know, full, empty, and somewhere in between. And then they also had this low level sensor. And once you hit that you only had so many seconds left of fuel. Well they ended up tripping that and so Bob Carlton pulled out a stopwatch and he talks about in his oral history how he put something very technical-- he put a couple pieces of scotch tape on his stopwatch--  Host: [Laughs] Yes, very technical.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: [Laugh] Yeah, very technical. So he clicked it and he said okay when it gets to 60 seconds it'll be here and when it gets to 30 seconds it'll be here and we'll only have just a little bit of time left. The other challenge that he was facing was that you couldn't go to the moon and leave the tank empty. They had to be able to call an abort and have some fuel left. And so he said he was just watching it so intently, you know? Every-- once they got down to that low level like people were just sweating in the MOCR and it was just so quiet. And so they got to 60 seconds. And he's starting to doubt whether or not they're going to be able to land. And then they get to 30 seconds and he said finally they landed and he clicked the stopwatch. 18 seconds left of fuel.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And so you know we often remember Charlie Duke telling the astronauts, you know, whew you got a bunch--  Host: You've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes and you know Bob Carlton really was that guy because he knew that at some point they probably were going to have to call an abort and he wasn't really sure they were going to be able to land at this point. So what's interesting though about the story, the sort of human aspect that I think is interesting is that he sees the stopwatch and he thinks what a great memento, what a great artifact of this mission. And so he takes it back to his office and he puts it in his desk because he wants to remember this moment. And you know he pulls it out occasionally but then he realizes well, you know, I probably shouldn't keep it at work because a janitor or somebody might come in my desk and just take it.  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So I'm going to take it home. So he puts it in a handkerchief and he carries it home and he puts it in a desk at home and occasionally he pulls it out. Well he pulls it out one time and he looks at it and he said, I must be losing my mind here because it should be at 18 seconds, it's at like 22 seconds, but he doesn't think anything of it he just puts it away. You know how all of us do that, we might have a trophy or a picture we'll look at it and put it away. And so he pulls it out again and it's on a different time this time. So he approaches one of his daughters who was a twirler and you know he asked her what's going on? Well it turns out she was using the stopwatch for her routines to time them and he was like oh okay that explains it. Well eventually he decided, you know, this was a great artifact, it needed to be somewhere else not in his house. So he donated it to the Smithsonian but he ended up winding the stopwatch back to 18 seconds--  Host: Oh.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So, you know, it would look like it did when they landed on the moon.  Host: Right. Right. That's where it ended up but--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: but little do people know this was used for twirling exercises.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right. Exactly. Yes. [laughs] I just think that's a great story because I think so many people can relate to that, especially with kids. You know you tell your kid don't touch this, and what does your kid want to do immediately? Touch it or--  Host: That's the only thing I want to touch now.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Exactly. Yes.  Host: Wonderful. Yeah you have-- that's a big story. You have a bunch of guys about to turn blue here because everyone was waiting. They had to-- they couldn't land in the area they were supposed to land, they had to find a new place to land which is why they were using all of these, all of this fuel. But it wasn't just those people in the primary Mission Control. You know a lot of people don't realize there are other rooms looking at other things. Even after they landed there's a room called the Mission Evaluation Room.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: Right? And there's, I like the story of Tom Sanzone monitoring the EVA. We actually got to interview him not too long ago at Rice Stadium. It was actually a weird coincidence that you have his--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Oh great.  Host: his name here. We have this great video where we have all these different Apollo alumni, current employees, astronauts, former astronauts and we gathered to celebrate the 50th anniversary but also remember John F. Kennedy's speech in '62 there on the field. And it just turned out to be this great thing. We pulled a couple people aside. Tom Sanzone just happened to be one of them. He has a great story because he was one of the portable life support system engineers right?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right, yeah.  Host: Yeah. So what was he doing in the MER?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so interestingly enough he was out in Pasadena originally because he was told to go home and get some rest because of course they were going to be monitoring the backpacks while they were doing an EVA on the moon. So he remembers being home, you know, sort of waiting. You know everyone was anticipating this moonwalk and the landing so he watches it at home on his television but then he's called and told to report for duty because they decided instead of a rest period the astronauts actually want to go out for a spacewalk. So, you know, he comes in and he said there were probably about eight people in the Mission Evaluation Room from Hamilton Standard which is who he works for who was in charge of that system. And you know it's kind of interesting, like I said, it's the support room for Mission Control but they're monitoring the backpacks for the astronauts. So he's monitoring Armstrong and there's another guy who's monitoring Armstrong's data as well and then they have two other engineers who are monitoring Buzz's backpack. And, you know, that backpack is really their whole life support system. Everything that we take for granted on Earth, that's what that backpack system provides. And so they're monitoring lots of different things like the amps, the batteries, the oxygen levels, the pressure of the suit, lots of different things. They actually got their data on cathode ray tubes so things would come out on TVs and they would graph that data using magic markers, by hand you know? Things that we're used to computers doing nowadays but they would do that by hand. They also had these displays with stopwatches because they wanted to make sure of course the astronauts are on the moon, the last thing you want is oh my gosh you know we have like 20 seconds left of oxygen, get in the LEM, you know?  Host: Yeah. Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You want to make sure there's ample oxygen and everything's going fine. So you're monitoring all of these things, all of these things with inside this space suit itself. And you know they are so focused on the task at hand, kind of like Bob Carlton was on that stopwatch, that Tom Sanzone doesn't even remember seeing Neil Armstrong or Buzz Aldrin walk on the moon. He doesn't remember that at all and he's not even sure there was a TV in the room but they were just so focused.  Host: They were looking at the data.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Mm-hmm.  Host: They were-- yeah they didn't have time to look at the TV, they were looking at that stopwatch. Oh man they're going out.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Yeah I remember talking to Tom Sanzone and the-- I think the funniest thing I learned from that is I did not realize that once the astronauts landed, the next thing was a rest period, for them to take a nap.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: And I remember Tom Sanzone when he was recalling this just laughing because he's like can you imagine, you landed on the moon and you're like hold on let me just take a quick nap.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: Of course they were excited. They wanted to go right out. So, yeah of course they weren't going to waste any time and oh let me just rest up a bit. They only had a couple hours really.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah it was about two and a half hours.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: To be out on the moon.  Host: Right so obviously yes you have to take care of that period you know I'll sleep later.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes. Well and you just imagine the excitement. You're kind of like a little kid. I mean this is a new playground for you to go out and see a new world.  Host: Yes.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And experience all of that.  Host: And you know what's great is they got to feel that way, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon, yeah I'm excited, let's go out. But they had people like Tom Sanzone in the back room that was busy looking at a stopwatch and you know couldn't, yes maybe he was excited but didn't have time to go check out a TV because he had a job to do and it was, you know, folks like him that actually made that possible. So I love these small stories of people in the background. It's amazing.  Real quick while we're talking about Tom Sanzone, we actually got to interview him at Rice Stadium while we were there so here's his version of the story. [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Tom Sanzone, and what was your job during the Apollo program?  Tom Sanzone: I was a portable life support system engineer. That's the backpack that they wore on the moon so I worked for Hamilton Standard was the name of the company then. It's a United Technologies Company. So we did all the testing, modifications, maintenance, flight prep, astronaut training in vacuum chambers and things like that. So I was involved with most of that stuff.  Host: Okay. Do you have highlights from your time working in portable life support systems, something, some story that comes to mind?  Tom Sanzone: Yeah I smile because I've been asked this before and what I tell people is when I was 22 years old 10 months out of Villanova I got to train Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 crew on how to use that life support system and my career has been downhill ever since. [laughs]  Host: Do you remember where you were during the Apollo 11 moon landing?  Tom Sanzone: Yeah. For the landing I was actually in my apartment in Pasadena primarily because the crew was supposed to sleep after they landed on the moon and then go out for their walk on the moon after they woke up. So we were going to monitor the performance and so they didn't want us hanging around and, you know, being tired so none of us really believed that they were going to sleep [laughs] you know so it wasn't a surprise. So I watched by myself in my apartment in Pasadena when they actually landed and then shortly thereafter I got a phone call saying you know they're not going to sleep, they're going to go out. I-- can you imagine sleeping on the moon when you just landed? [laughs] And so then I, you know I drove in and I worked in what's called a Mission Evaluation Room, you know, one of the back rooms of Mission Control.  [ Transition Sound ]  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I don't think people realize how many people were working in the background.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Just making sure everything was operating smoothly, you know? The astronauts get sort of all the credit and the attention but there were so many people that contributed to the Apollo Program in so many different ways.  Host: And this next story is a perfect example of that because this is the story of a guy who honestly didn't even appreciate the landing on the moon until much later. I love this story.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so Ed Fendell, he did an interview with our project years ago and he is on console also with Gene Kranz's team. He's the ENCO console. And he remembers as the landing is happening, he's kind of levitating in his chair. And he knows that he wasn't really levitating, but that's kind of, it was just so surreal. He didn't really think they were going to land on the moon the first time. He thought that maybe they would try but it wouldn't happen. But it's just so surreal he feels like he was levitating and you know they do the change of shift and he goes home. He decides to, you know, go back to his apartment, get some rest, cleans up, and decides to grab some breakfast before he heads in for work the next day. And he goes by what's called a Dutch Kettle. It's like a coffee shop and nearby his apartment and he decides to go sit at the counter. He's got a newspaper with him and he orders breakfast. Said he ordered scrambled eggs. I'm sure he got some other stuff but he was sitting there and some guys walked in from a gas station down the street and, you know, you could tell because they were in their overalls and you know they're kind of greasy, but they were talking about the Apollo 11 mission and talking about how they had been through World War II, they were at Normandy and D Day, they walked through Paris and made it to Berlin, and one of the guys said but yesterday was the proudest I've been to be an American. And Ed Fendell was sitting there and he heard that and it suddenly hit him what they had done. And he picked up his newspaper and left the restaurant and he started to cry and he just kind of lost it because until that point, you know he knew we landed on the moon but I don't think it hit him, you know like it had hit so many other Americans across the globe who were just excited. Like Dottie Lee mentioned, so many people were at the bars celebrating. People were in Times Square. But it hadn't hit this person who was in the MOCR who was so focused on getting the task done until this moment, what they had really achieved and what it meant to the citizens of this country. And he said he still has this paper til this day. You know he cried in his car and decided to come into work and but that's just such a great moment. I mean it really speaks to what was happening with some of these guys in the MOCR. It was a great achievement but it didn't really hit home initially--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: what had happened.   Host: It-- certainly that story gives me an appreciation for how focused these guys were. You know like it's not just, they're not just the front row seat for this whole thing. It's way beyond that. It's these guys that had their head buried in all of the data to make sure that the mission was going to be successful really just working hard to get the mission done and not truly realizing or appreciating the world around them and everything that was happening because you have guys looking at stopwatches, you have guys monitoring data, you have guys just making sure that after you know 18 seconds left of fuel that everything's going to run smoothly and we're going to get these guys home. You know it's not just we landed on the moon. The mission's not over at that point.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: And it's something that I think, you know even these human interest stories, these, and not even human interest but just these very human stories really, you know, help you to appreciate that.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Very much. And I should add, you know, a lot of people that we've talked to over the years who were part of the Apollo Program talk about how they were so singularly focused they didn't really know what was going on with Vietnam or Civil Rights. All of these things that were erupting around the U.S. and the story that I always like to tell people is Al Bean who was the lunar module pilot on Apollo 12 said he didn't really learn about all these things until much later thanks to the Discovery Channel. And this is before he came to NASA but he said he didn't even know who Rosa Parks was. You know Rosa Parks, that was in like the 50's.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: But I mean that's a good example of just how involved they were in Apollo. Their noses were very deep into these subjects and they weren't watching the news, they weren't reading the papers, they were singularly focused on achieving the goal of landing a man on the moon.  Host: Yeah. Of course there was a lot going on in '69 you know? This was definitely even to some of these guys were some of the most, one of the proudest American achievements landing on the moon but you did have Vietnam going on. I know a popular, was it a book or a movie, \"The Andromeda Strain\"?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah \"The Andromeda Strain\", the book.  Host: It was a book, yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah by Michael Crichton, yeah.  Host: Yeah. So this next story about, is it John Hirasaki?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: John Hirasaki, yeah.  Host: John Hirasaki, \"The Andromeda Strain\". That's, that was interesting because that was the, almost, I don't know, \"The Andromeda Strain\" is I guess about this virus that comes to Earth or something, right?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I remember reading it-- I haven't read it in a while but I remember reading it in college and thinking oh this is crazy, you know, that you would have to-- I think it was sort of based on this idea of a Lunar Receiving Lab and sort of going in and having to like burn your skin off when you would want to come out because of this bug that came to Earth and just this sort of scary environment.  Host: Yeah but it really helps you to put into perspective like that was a thing. People were very, you know, the moon, we were landing on the moon but part of the mission was getting all this stuff back and people had no idea what to expect. What is on the moon? So they were handling these things with such care because we don't know. We can get a virus and bring it back, who knows?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right. Yeah, yeah. There was a big concern. A lot of people who worked at NASA weren't as concerned because they thought the moon was a sterile environment.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So initially when we were planning for the moon landing there wasn't this idea of a Lunar Receiving Lab. That came a little bit later. You know we were really focused on engineering. But then scientists themselves who weren't working at NASA became concerned that we were going to be bringing back people and rocks and soil from the moon and, you know, what impact would that have on plants? What impact would that have on humanity and animals? Could that have a detrimental impact? And maybe we need a quarantine facility. So that started the whole discussion about whether or not the crew needed to be quarantined and for how long and the safety of the planet and all of these concerns.  Host: Yeah we've had a couple podcast episodes so far with some of the folks in the lunar lab and other folks who study meteorites and I think one of the best things from the Apollo 11 mission was when Neil Armstrong, you know they had these containers that they were supposed to put all the rocks in, but after they put the rocks there was a lot of empty space. So what does Neil Armstrong do? He starts-- he gets out the shovel and starts putting in some of the soil--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: from on top just to fill some of this empty space. You know, why not? So they're on the moon and a lot of the folks say that that was some of the best stuff that they brought back with them. Not the rocks but the soil themselves. It revealed a lot about the moon and about Earth's history.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Very cool story. So what's the story on Hirasaki?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I'm going to sort of intertwine that with Randy Stone--  Host: Oh yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: because they both worked for the landing and recovery division. They're both young guys who came in and they're both actually on the ship, the USS Hornet, which is the ship that's going to pick up the crew coming back from the moon for the first time. And so they both work for the landing and recovery division. They're both engineers. Randy Stone is the lead engineer for the folks outside of the mobile quarantine facility. And John Hirasaki is actually going to be quarantined with the crew that's coming back inside the mobile quarantine facility. And so I want to just talk a little bit about Randy Stone first because I think it kind of gives an idea of what's happening and then we can talk about John. We'll probably go back and forth between the two.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: But he was on the ship for a while. You know they were practicing things. They knew that President Nixon was going to be coming on board and so they were practicing maneuvers and routines and trying to get things ready for when the crew was coming and for when the president was coming. When the president comes, he actually models the biologic isolation garment for the president which I wish I'd seen a picture of it. I haven't been able to find a photo of it. But I, you know I think that's kind of interesting that he would be working on these things. And John Hirasaki is placed on board but he's placed inside of the mobile quarantine facility. They actually drew straws. There were four guys who were interested in being in that mobile quarantine facility. Even though, you know, there were fears about maybe bringing back a lunar bug and you know nobody knew what they might be bringing back and what impact that might have. He was actually a newlywed. He had married someone about six months earlier and so of course \"The Andromeda Strain\" is on her mind. But you know people wanted to make a contribution. People were willing to say, you know, hey I'll participate. I would like to do that task. And so he got the short straw and was in the mobile quarantine facility. He was put in early because there were concerns that, you know, he might catch something from some of the crew on the Hornet and they didn't want him to have any sort of cold or virus and give that to the crew themselves. And there was another person who was in the mobile quarantine facility and that was Dr. Carpentier, their physician at that time. So like you said, you know there were some concerns that they had but he's, you know he's got a front row seat. When the crew comes back he's got a front row seat to hearing the stories that the crew would tell about landing on the moon for the first time which is really exciting of course because when you go somewhere exciting and interesting you want to come back you want to tell people all about it. And they're locked in this quarantine facility because people are concerned, hey maybe you brought back a lunar bug. Maybe you're going to infect humanity as we know it. So they've got a chance to actually sit and talk with the crew and they tell their stories. So here, we need to go back now to Randy Stone because John Hirasaki is in the mobile quarantine facility. They bring back the crew, they go into the mobile quarantine facility but they also need to bring back the command module. And inside the command module are things like the rocks, as you talked about. There are also photos that they need to get back here to Houston to process. And Hirasaki, that's going to be one of his tasks. Well, Randy Stone is in charge of sort of safing the command module and, you know, there's a lot of toxins on board and so they need to make sure that the reaction control system jets are safed. And they also need to attach the command module to the mobile quarantine facility which is a trailer essentially that they're living in. And so they sort of snap it on but then he talks about how they've got hundreds of rolls of yellow tape. He said they used to joke that they couldn't go to the moon without yellow tape. He said it's like duct tape is today. You know--  Host: Oh.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: you just use it for everything. And so, you know, they had to seal up the command module with all this yellow tape so there would be a good seal. Even though it snapped on they wanted to make sure nothing made its way out. You know they were very concerned about that trying to protect, like I said, humanity and animals and plant life here all across the globe. Not just Americans themselves. And so once they had done that, John Hirosaki was able to go into the command module and do some of the things that he needed to do. One of the first things that he mentioned that he had to do was take photographs of the command module, the interior. This is what it looked like before anybody touched it. You know this is where the switches were. This is how things, where things were located. And so he did that and then he reaches in and he grabs the rock boxes which you mentioned, and he also grabs the magazines, the photos that the crew had taken because here in Houston they want both of those things. And then there's also a beta cloth bag of luner rocks that they're going to take with them back in the mobile quarantine facility. Interestingly enough though, he has to take those boxes and he has to vacuum seal them before he can give them to Randy Stone because Randy Stone is going to take those boxes and put them on a carrier. But they need to be decontaminated because of course they're in the command module so he vacuum seals them and then puts them in a decontamination lock which Randy Stone describes it as using a, you know, a really toxic Clorox solution because they have to be rinsed and washed. And he said that, you know, it would hurt your hands. It would stain your clothes. It smelled horrible. But you wanted to make sure of course you killed everything. So he said, you know, his most memorable moment though was getting that box-- those boxes which were made here by our tech services people-- and taking them with the Marine guard. He said he thought it was rather funny, he's on a Naval carrier but he's got Marine guards with him taking it to the plane as if anybody's going to jump on him and grab these lunar rocks. And he said that was probably his proudest moment. But then John Hirosaki remains in that mobile quarantine facility. And interesting enough, he's sort of the chef and bottle washer is what he likes to call himself. Of course they had to eat and they had something new in that mobile quarantine facility, a microwave. They had an Amana Radarange which a lot of households-- nowadays everybody has a microwave but at that point a lot of households didn't. And so he was actually in charge of picking out the kind of meals that they would have in the mobile quarantine facility when they were doing tests. People wanted them to have like fancy meals like Lobster Thermidor and other things--  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: and he was like nah, I think we need something else.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Maybe just like meat and potatoes kind of thing.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So, you know, he spent a lot of time, you know, preparing meals and doing those sort of things. And obviously just chatting with the crew, learning more about the mission itself. And then once they got to the Lunar Receiving Lab here in Houston he helped do some work here and obviously he was in quarantine with the rest of the crew.  Host: Wow. So that must've been quite a long time then that he was in quarantine.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah they were in quarantine for a total of 21 days but that started from the minute that they left the lunar surface, a total of 21 days. So--  Host: Got it. Okay. Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah they wanted to be sure that, you know, they didn't have any lunar bugs that they brought back just in case.  Host: I know. Yeah you go through all these different measures to make sure you're not touching anything too much which I think blends in nicely with the next story.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so Terry Slezak is a photographer who is in the Lunar Receiving Lab when the crew gets back. But before the crew actually left, he had been for a time trying to figure out how they were going to safe the film, you know make sure that they could process that film, make sure it wasn't contaminated with lunar bugs. And so he'd been doing a lot of simulations in the Lunar Receiving Lab which is an awfully complicated process which I probably won't go into because I'll probably slaughter it. But you know they were trying different ways of making sure they could safely process the film but not release anything out into the public that wasn't safe. And so, you know, they tried different ways of protecting the film. They put like nylon in between the film itself. Of course you couldn't expose it to light, otherwise you would destroy the images. So they ended up using an autoclave trying to protect the film and interleaving it with a Kodak paper that they used. Well it worked fine for most of the simulations. And they would also introduce bacteria into some of the simulations because they wanted to make sure the autoclave was working and make sure that bacteria would be killed and he would try and grow bacteria on Petri dishes. Well things seemed to be working fine until like the day before they were going to bring back all that film and what happened is he got a phone call from his chief and said did you do something different to the film this time? And he said no, didn't do anything differently. And it turns out all of the film in the canisters that he brought back over had melted in the bottom. So you know they were of course were very concerned because here we are, we've spent how many billions of dollars going to the moon and you know we might actually destroy this flight film. And we might not have a record of what happened on Apollo 11. So they had to go back and figure out what happened. They had to fix the autoclave. They had to replumb it and they had to do another simulation to make sure everything worked safely this time. And then of course they brought back the rock boxes. They brought back the photos. Well that's photos-- the film, the canisters. And so Terry Slezak is working with this film and he notices there's a note from Buzz Aldrin that you know this is the most important magazine but Neil dropped it on the moon and he doesn't think anything of it. He pulls it out and there's all this black dust. And everyone around him is looking at him and he's like whoa, what is that? And he's like oh it's lunar dust.  Host: Oh my God.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And everyone of course is kind of concerned because they're like oh well, you know, that's lunar dust and we're just in plain clothes. So they take a picture of him. He's got lunar dust. If you go on our website you can actually see it so--  Host: Oh cool.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: he holds that up. He becomes known as the first man to touch lunar dust. [laughs] But then there are protocols that have to be followed. He has to take a shower. He has to clean up with lots of Clorox. But in the meantime of course being a photographer and knowing about this historic moment, he is mainly concerned about the film. You know he's not necessarily concerned about himself, but he's concerned that this material is really going to be too rough on the film, it's going to scratch it. And that we might lose the film anyways because of the lunar dust. So he's very concerned about this. But Terry Slezak is an interesting guy. You know he's in the lunar receiving lab, so in addition to taking care of the film he's doing a lot of other tasks. He used to be an army medic so he's taking the vitals of the crew like blood pressure and their temperatures and things like that. He's also showing films in the crew reception area to the folks. They actually brought in some films so they could actually have some entertainment when they didn't have anything else to do. But they were actually quite busy in there. He also was helping to safe the command module. The command module made its way back to the Lunar Receiving Lab and there were a lot of toxins in there that had to be removed. He said he went out to North American and learned how to safe the vehicle and learned a lot about the plumbing. And he was told look, I have enough to do because he was also in charge of taking photos inside the Lunar Receiving Lab. And they said oh you can just add it to your list, no big deal. He also helped clean out the command module and he said it was kind of a gross, yucky task. There were things in there that nobody would want to touch like used wash cloths, you know? When they would shave there'd be all these whiskers on there and things and they had to document everything that they took out and put it on a list. So, you know, he was quite busy. And he actually talks about what life was like in the Lunar Receiving Lab. He said it was just crazy, that people were constantly calling. They wanted to know, like what was going on. He said people would call at like 3 o'clock in the morning, hey you know we just want to know what's going on in the Lunar Receiving Lab and he's like I'm trying to sleep. [laughs] Like, what do you think is going on?  Host: He slept in the receiving lab?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So.  Host: Random people or like managers and like--?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: He said it was their secretary.  Host: Okay.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So, but you know I imagine that there were a lot of people, probably the news media as well--  Host: Oh yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: you know wanting the stories. And he was taking photos. He said he would post photos of what was happening in the Lunar Receiving Lab, you know, so people could come take photos of those photos. So, you know, there was a lot happening. There was a lot of attention on these guys and this building. Even though the mission was over.  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Yeah. I guess mission-- yeah the mission itself but maybe not the entirety of the mission. All the processing afterwards that happens especially the moon rocks and all. Every-- all the scientists probably wanted them too. This Terry Slezak you said?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Mm-hmm. Yeah.  Host: A very interesting guy. Photographer. Former medic. Technician. Movie--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Like he made it into a movie theater. Janitor. He was cleaning stuff.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: [Laughs] right.  Host: Very interesting stuff, yeah. A man with many hats. Very, very cool. There's an interesting story about the flag on Apollo 11. I think this is a very good one too.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah. So Jack Kinzler who we talked about who was our first oral history interview--  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know head of our-- chief of tech services here at JSC. Well MSC at the time. You know he was called into a committee that Bob Gilruth had in his office and they were talking about, you know, what they might do to celebrate this lunar landing. Like how can we demonstrate-- we did it. What can we do on the moon? And so the first thing that he suggested was well there needs to be a plaque. You know, something that demonstrates what happened. You know something where people can look and see, or another creature can look and see what we did. So he decided to go back and come up with some dummy plaques. And so he came up with the idea of a plaque with a flag on top of it, and sort of the astronaut's name and then he presented that to Bob Gilruth and the rest of the committee and they said oh okay, you know, we'll think about that. And they sent it up to headquarters. Headquarters worked on the wording and then they came back with-- and I wanted to make sure I got it right so I brought. “Here men from the planet Earth”-- excuse me, sorry my eyes – “set foot upon the moon July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.” Which interestingly enough I read in an interview with Tom Paine who said that originally they wanted to say we come in peace for mankind but the White House who also had a chance to review the plaque changed it to came. And they also decided to add the president's name to the bottom because originally Jack Kinzler said they weren't going to include the president because this was a NASA endeavor.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: It didn't involve the White House. But they decided to go ahead and put Richard Nixon's name on there.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And you also notice on the plaque itself that there's the two hemispheres. He said that Bob Gilruth was looking at the plaque and he saw the flag and he said you know it might be more interesting actually if you put the two hemispheres there because if there's another creature that comes upon the moon, someday wants to figure out well where's Earth, you know they're not necessarily going to know where Earth is, but they could look and see this image and know oh that's the planet. That's where they came from.  Host: Ah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And so he said that's where the idea originally came from. So the flag though was also something that Jack Kinzler was very interested in because he thought, you know, that would be a great way to mark the moment, to unfurl the flag on the moon. And you know you would think well that's easy, we'll just go down to Sears or Kmart and we'll just buy a flag.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And you actually couldn't do that. So they had to come up with a flagpole and they had to come up with something that could be stowed on the lunar module and so they came up with this flag. It was the three foot by five foot flag that they came up with and decided how it was going to operate. They had to test it out. They also had to make sure it would fit on the lunar module so they went out to the lunar module that they have here and made sure it would all fit, they would be able to tuck it away safely. And then he had to go down and actually train the astronauts in how to deploy the flag on the moon. So he had to go down to the Kennedy Space Center and show Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin how this was all going to work. So they had to practice. And then he installed the flag on the lunar module along with the plaque before it went up to the moon. So you know a lot of people-- you probably hear a lot of conspiracy stories about how of course we didn't really go to the moon. A lot of people say well one reason is because if you look at that flag that's on the moon, it looks like it's fluttering in the wind. Well, Jack Kinzler had come up with this idea because of course they wanted you to be able to see the flag so they actually stitched a hem on this flag and they had an aluminum rod that would go through. You were actually supposed to completely stretch it out so it'd be completely straight for the photos. But the crew noticed that it would-- if was kind of fluttering, you know the way it might flutter here on Earth and so they didn't extend that aluminum rod that whole way. They decided to leave it where it looked like it was fluttering.  Host: Ah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And so to this day a lot of people say well of course it's on a sound stage somewhere in Burbank or what have you, and but he had designed it that way.  Host: Wow. So it would've been-- if they'd just pulled it out just all the way it would've been a completely stiff flag which was the design of it.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Right. It would've been taught, yes.  Host: Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, that's one of those things but it's, yeah it's just, they didn't pull the rod out all the way.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right, yeah.  Host: Interesting.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Wow. That's cool. I like that. I don't know if this is a true story so I don't even know if I should tell it but it was just one of those things when because when I first started working here I started giving tours of the Apollo 11 Mission Control Room--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Oh yeah.  Host: which is now being restored here on Friday. So or they're going to open it up to the public on Friday. But one of the things we used to tell was that plaque that you were saying, I believe they made three of them if I'm not mistaken. The plaque that they actually put on the moon, they had a replica of it in that room and it was hanging on the wall underneath one of the flags that they brought to the moon which actually ended up being one of the Apollo 11 flags through some story that I won't tell here. But it literally said the same exact thing that you just said, we came in peace for all mankind. And the story that we always used to tell was that there were three plaques made by three different contractors and every one of those contractors wanted to know-- they were identical plaques-- they wanted to know which plaque ended up on the moon so that contractor can say my plaque, and they, and I guess no one ever told them or no one ever knew which one was which so that way they can all share credit.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: And I forget where that third one is. One's here and the other one's on the moon and I think the other one I want to say is in the Smithsonian so I can't say for sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I hadn't heard that story before.  Host: Yeah. Yeah it was one of those things that we always used to tell. It was really cool. They had like little artifacts all around the moon and I think they're going to bring them all back for the Apollo MOCR opening here soon.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Oh well that's great.  Host: Yeah. But it was just one of those stories. I love that story. I think this is a great story to end it all off because we started with, you know, some shuttle astronauts recalling seeing the moon landing as a kid. We went even before the moon landing to say this is when shuttle started and we went all the way through but, you know, after the astronauts landed of course you know you were saying the whole world was celebrating. And so the astronauts went around the world to celebrate with them. And it was sort of this parade. So what was this thing? What was the, this I guess parade of astronauts going all around the world?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so there was a goodwill tour that the president sent the astronauts and their wives on. And so it was a tour of 22 countries in 38 days so it was sort of this whirlwind tour.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And we have an interview with one of the secretaries who went with the crew and their wives. Geneva Barnes tells some interesting stories from that great, or \"Giant leaps\" tour and you know it was just an exhausting tour. You know they would spend a night at every location except for I think she mentioned Bankok and Rome. You know they were just constantly on the move. They had a plane. They were in the Vice President's plane, Air Force Two which they considered really their home away from home. They had meals there. They could drink the water there. They could take naps. So it was really nice for them because they were constantly on the move. Everyone just wanted a piece of the astronauts. Everybody wanted to see them. Crowds were everywhere. You know the first place that they went, Mexico City, I mean if you've ever seen the photos, I mean it's just amazing how close the crowds are to the Apollo 11 crew.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And she talks about the fact that they were so busy-- they were so jetlagged, they were constantly moving around. They weren't, you know, as you and I do when we go on travel, we're probably tired. We're not eating well. We're not sleeping well because we're not in our own beds. And she said that a lot of the embassies, the state department embassies would talk to each other when they were coming, when they were scheduled to come, and they would talk about the fact that well, you know, there have been some illnesses on the crew, you know these-- because they didn't just come with the wives and the astronauts and Geneva Barnes, there were other people that came. And they were worried that well maybe you know that quarantine period wasn't long enough because maybe the crew actually did bring back some sort of lunar germ because everyone's been getting sick and some people had flu-like symptoms. And the physician that came with them, Dr. Carpentier who was also onboard the mobile quarantine facility and in the LRO--  Host: I remember the name, yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. So he had to actually go talk to the media when they were in London and explain, no the crew didn't bring back any lunar bugs, you know? They were just tired. They were just, you know, they had a hectic schedule and they were just kind of worn out which I think is, you know, kind of amusing that people would actually be concerned about that. They had already gone through a quarantine.  Host: Yeah well it was, I mean this, we've brought up this idea of a lunar bug through so many different parts of this story. You could tell it was just something that was so prominent in the world.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well you know it was a big fear.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: A big unknown at that point.  Host: An unknown, exactly.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. And we still would quarantine the crews, you know? And we still quarantined 12 and 14 just to be sure even though the Apollo 11 crew was fine. But she also tells a number of other interesting stories. She talks about for instance going to Belgrade. They met the deputy prime minister there and they invited the astronauts out for a duck shoot and they took their wives on a tour down the Danube River and they took them out for a seven course lunch and they said that they were so full. And that lasted until four or five in the afternoon and then they got word that well the chef's back at the hotel they were staying at got a hold of the ducks and they were planning this huge dinner for them. So they were, you know, stuffed already from this huge meal.  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And they had to go back to the hotel and get ready for dinner and eat whatever the chefs had come up with using these ducks. They really only had one rest stop that she remembers. When they went to Rome she couldn't remember if there was an American ambassador there at the embassy at the time but they gave them the afternoon there at the embassy. So they had a chance to just really relax and be themselves and play tennis. And she mentions that they ate hamburgers and hot dogs and potato salad. I mean how much more American can you get, right? [laughter]  Host: Probably much needed after this, you know-- was that probably towards the middle of the tour too, just a break.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I think they really needed it because there were so many crowds. She talks about going to Senegal for instance in Dakar. And she said the plane landed and these crowds just rushed toward the plane. They had to turn off the jets because they were just like here come all these people, you know just tons and tons of people. They finally managed to get them out and into cars and she said that was challenging as well because, you know, they were supposed to be following each other to the hotel but she said they're-- people managed to wedge their way in between the vehicles. She said it was so scary because at one point security came back and told them to get out of their vehicle because they were taking their car for the astronaut wives. And they said find another way-- find another car-- and she was like how are we going to find another car? They managed but she said they were all kind of squished on each other, sitting on each other's laps. She said it was just so crazy. At one point the car that had the astronauts started to overheat and she said she doesn't understand the mechanics but she said she'd heard that if you want to make sure your car doesn't overheat, you turn on the heater and that sort of helps things.  Host: Oh.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And so she said they ended up taking a shortcut through a soccer field and made their way to the hotel which she said it was just a very scary moment because people were just, you know, they wanted to see these astronauts, hear these celebrities that came back from the moon. And they wanted a picture of them or just a glimpse of them.  Host: Everybody was going nuts. Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: They were. Yeah they had space fever, you know?  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And when they went to Bombay in India, she said a lot of people from the embassy didn't go out but they estimated there were about a million and a half people who were there just to see the astronauts.  Host: Wow. Huge country. Huge population.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So, huge crowds. Yeah.  Host: Yeah huge crowd.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. And then she said when they went to the Congo which is a very different story from when they went to Senegal, she said that there was a lot, a lot more crowd control there because the president had put in place these police officers with whips. So if somebody tried to step out and go to the plane or get in front of an astronaut car or try and open the door a whip would come down on them and they'd scurry back to the sidewalk or the location that they were supposed to be at. Like kind of scary.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Imagine like seeing that.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. She said that the place that they ended up staying was outside of town. It was near a private zoo that the president owned and you could actually hear the animals at night, the wild animals. So, you know there's some interesting stories from there. Probably the other interesting story she told was when they went to Tehran they were actually able to see the jewels that the Shah had. And they were locked away behind glass and so they told them don't touch the glass with your forehead or your hands. It'll create a huge problem. Then of course somebody didn't follow directions and so doors-- alarms went off, doors started shutting. They managed to get everybody out in time but, you know, that was probably another scary moment.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: I mean these stories are incredible, the ones Geneva is telling. But I can just imagine trying to-- because she's the secretary, she's part of the organization of this--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: trying to come up with alternate routes if you're getting broken up and now you have to deal with okay now the doors are closing on us and alarms are going off, what do we do? That had to be one of the most stressful like tours that you could possibly go on with that many people just so excited in every single place you go. And I think that's one of the great things about this mission is how it captivated the whole world. I know-- I think it's in the book \"Marketing the Moon\", I forget exactly the number so this might not be a good thing to quote but I'll do it anyway, is I think 95% of the world's televisions were tuned into the moon landing I believe. Everybody was. Now again this is a time when there was three channels but you know it's, it was one of those things where everybody was tuned in. So naturally everyone would be excited and all the papers would say man landed on the moon. And it was for all of mankind too so everyone was engaging with it.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right, yes.  Host: It was just a wonderful thing.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: I mean the United States accomplished this goal but I think the whole world saw it as an opportunity as Neil Armstrong said-- a giant leap for mankind. He didn't say it was a giant leap for the United States of America.  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Yeah. And that was intentional, right? They thought about that ahead of time.   [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Hope you really enjoyed these stories from Dr. Ross-Nazzal. It was some great stuff. And thanks for sticking around. We have a few more stories to tell but these will be told by the people who actually experienced them. At the beginning I mentioned we made a video at Rice Stadium very recently and had a chance to pull aside some alumni of the Apollo Program who had some interesting stories. So, here they are. I hope you enjoy. First is George Fletcher who actually experienced John F. Kennedy's speech at Rice Stadium.  [ Transition Sound ]  George Fletcher: Okay I'm George Fletcher. I was about in the 7th grade when we were sitting in class and all of the sudden the teacher comes running into the classroom, everybody up, everybody up. And so we all got up. They hustled us out to the bus and we got on the bus and somewhere along the line we learned we were going to go listen to the president. Okay, fine. So we went out to Rice Stadium and they had us come off the bus, get into the stands, and we all sat prim and proper just like we'd always been taught and we listened to the president. Well I say we listened, I was in the 7th grade and so I wasn't all that excited about what he had to say, at least not at that point in time, but we listened politely. And it was hot. It was very hot. And after it was over, we got back on the bus and had to go back to school. But it was a very exciting time because when I look back on it and see the importance of what he was saying at that time, and then for me to graduate from school and go to work in the space program, it means a lot more to me now that I was there. I appreciate being there.  Interviewer: So what did you in the space program? Tell me about your adult life?  George Fletcher: I worked-- started out as a quality engineer but transitioned over to systems safety and I've been in systems safety for nearly 40 years.  Interviewer: So were you a NASA contractor or--?  George Fletcher: Contractor, yes.  Interviewer: Okay.  George Fletcher: And I started out, the last four days-- I came to the center on the last four days of Skylab 4 and after that I went through the ASTP program, went through the complete shuttle program, did some with space station, and now I'm back doing Orion.  [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Here's Don Whalen who actually worked on all the unmanned and manned missions of the Apollo Program.  [ Transition Sound ]  Interviewer: What was your technical expertise?  Don Whalen: The Environmental Control System. I worked on the-- it's called the ECS, the Environmental Control System on the command module for Apollo. And we, you know, worked on the design, development, test, certification, and mission readiness for the system.  Interviewer: Now I don't want you to get like mad about astronauts, but talk about the people behind the scenes. You know you see all these movies and you always see the, you know, Tom Hanks doesn't play you. [laughs] How many people, you know, go into all that amazing stuff that happens and is in front of the cameras and, you know, the going to the moon and all this? How many people go behind the scenes and what's the importance of the workers behind all that stuff?  Don Whalen: Well the workers behind the scenes is what gets the job done. We were in the engineering directorate. Unfortunately all you hear, a lot of the people hear, is mission control. But we wouldn't have had any missions without us in engineering designing, development, and certifying the system to keep them living. So we worked hand in hand with the guys in mission control, but it seems like that's all the general public knows is mission control. [laughs]  Interviewer: Yeah. Seems like they need somebody like you designing environmental systems for a moon base.  Don Whalen: [Laughs] They've probably already got something in mind already you know? But, yeah no we work, we work with the contractors. You know AIR Research out in Downy, out in California, designed the environmental control system for the command module. So, and then we used to take trips out there. The unfortunate thing that is always in my mind is the Apollo 1 fire. And I had just left mission control working with the guys and on the way home that's when it happened. So we had a lot of going through to do and, you know, get ready again. It was an unfortunate situation.  Interviewer: The timeline for getting, for you know failures and then getting somebody on the moon. At the time was it an unbelievable task what y’all were doing, because that's the way it's kind of described, you know, when you hear about the history of it.  Don Whalen: Yeah well we were zeroed in on our subsystem. That was our job, to get it ready. Everybody el- all the other subsystems were in the same boat. All this stuff about beating Russia to the moon and all was at the upper levels and they were controlling what we did, but it was our job to get our subsystem ready and certified for flight. And that's what we did.  [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Here's Gary Evans and Jim Kelly, both of whom were EECOM and were reunited at this video shoot.   [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Gentlemen, thank you so much for coming. I'm just going to ask you a couple questions. First, when you were invited to come to this event to film at Rice Stadium with all of these Apollo alumni, current JSC employees, and even current astronauts, what really drew you to come today?  Gary Evans: It seemed like a good idea.  Jim Kelly: Yeah.   Gary Evans: We got a lot of things coming up and there's going to be a lot of media building up for that so I thought I'd support this. I'm really curious to see how the film's going to look from perspective of being on the field with all the people. It was a lot of fun. Lot of fun. It was good to see the people too. Lot of friends here today.  Host: It's like a reunion.  Jim Kelly: I was kind of just enjoying recognition for a lot of old folks that did a good job back then that have probably long been forgotten.  Gary Evans: Yes.  Jim Kelly: There's a-- it was a lot of hard work, a lot of people and I just came down hopefully to see some of my old buddies. I found one by the way. [laughs] Gary and I worked together for quite a few times.  Host: What were you doing then? What were you working on during the Apollo program?  Jim Kelly: Both of us were flight controllers. We were in the Mission Control Center and we both supported the position EECOM.  Host: What were some of the highlights of your time as EECOM?  Gary Evans: EECOM? Well it was, the whole ride was 40 years and a week so it started a long time ago and just to be there and to participate in support was more than anybody would ever expect. We were the luckiest people around to get the opportunity.  Host: Do you remember where you were during the Apollo moon landing?  Jim Kelly: Yes. On console. I was one of the few that followed the flight plan rather than a mission schedule. My sys- one of my systems expertise besides the electrical communication and instrumentation and sequential systems was the docking system. So I was there in the event that they aborted the landing and we had to re-dock. In the event that we had a problem I was the resident docking specialist for hardware.  Host: And how about you Gary?  Gary Evans: I was still in California. I had been here during the Gemini Program and supported a lot of the EVAs and the hardware. We built the umbilical and the chest pack for that so I had known a lot of the people in building seven-- the crew systems division-- and I'd been supporting Apollo for the entire time also. So we worked a lot of integration but I was busy working on something on the west coast.  Host: Can you tell me do you remember where you were during JFK's speech?  Jim Kelly: Yeah I was still in high school.  Host: Really?  Jim Kelly: Yeah. I was sitting out-- my father was military and we were stationed in Germany and we'd just got back from our German assignment and I was in my senior year of high school and that's where I was and lord and behold, a couple of years later I was just one of them.  Gary Evans: And I was working in California still on the Environmental Control System for Apollo and for Gemini which was still going at the time. And JFK did something for us also. Some of us were on the critical path for getting to the moon and they went out and saw that we didn't have to get, to go to Vietnam. They kind of I guess protected us where we ended up on a list, a bunch of us, and we were fortunate to do that.  Host: Wonderful.  Gary Evans: So, it was a, he was a smart man but he was really ready to go and he got everybody fired up, I'll tell you. It was a good thing. It was good times.  Host: Now last thing, those badges are pretty interesting. Can you tell me what they mean?  Jim Kelly: Mine's a mission badge for Apollo 11 I wore. It gave me access to the control center. So I've got one of these from GT 76 all the way through the Soyuz Mission. I was a mission controller.  Host: How about yours Gary?  Gary Evans: I worked for Rockwell International at the time and I worked for Apollo 16, 15, 14, 17, so I supported those in Mission Control as a life support in the background.  [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Lastly, here's Reuben Taylor. He was one of the managers for the ascent propulsion system on the lunar module and has a great story of how critical that component was.  [ Transition Sound ]  Reuben Taylor: I was, I came to Houston to be one of the managers for the ascent propulsion system on the lunar module. I came to Houston in 1964 and so we worked the system all the way up through the last Apollo landing. And one of the interesting things that-- Neil Armstrong, before we ever went to land on the moon, called over said hey would you come over, I want to talk to you about redesigning the engines. And what he wanted us to do was to put in manual valves to start the engine in case he didn't have electrical power. And I said well that's a tough order. So I said if you're concerned about the-- not having electrical power, well we've got electrical strings coming in from multiple sources so we're not really concerned about power. But in addition, if you do lose power, you've got to have power for the reaction control systems which stabilize you as you're coming off the moon. And so it's, there's a lot here that you're asking us to do. I didn't tell him but we were also on a tight schedule and it was not really a very practical thing to do because our rocket engines started up in like three tenths of a second we were almost 100% power. So after listening me out he says okay, thanks for coming over and the end of conversation. [laughs] So we did not have to go redesign the engine. The thing about the ascent propulsion system, it was the only component on the entire Apollo program that did not have a backup, okay? If that engine failed, that's it. The guys stay on the moon. We had one engine, no backup system. That engine had to fire up and we used hypergolic propellants. It was no spark plugs or anything to start. No igniters. You mixed the propellants and they automatically start to burn. And the thing about Apollo 13 was I was home getting ready to go to bed, it was about 10:30 o'clock and one of my co-workers called me and says hey you better come up here, we've got a problem. [laughs] And so I went up there and found out that the guys were transferring into the lunar module and, to make it around, all the way around the moon and back. So I had an interesting time here at NASA and I retired in 1987 and just had a blast.  [ Transition Sound ]  Host: These, Jennifer, are absolutely fascinating stories. And I think I'm going to kind of reiterate that point that was, you know, we see a lot when we think about Apollo 11, you know we like to look at Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin. We like to look at Gene Kranz which were, you know, astounding figures in the history. And I was so excited to dive into some of the lesser known stories. This was absolutely fascinating, so I appreciate you coming on Jennifer to tell these wonderful, wonderful stories. This was very exciting.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah, it's my pleasure. And I hope if folks are interested they'll go out and look at the oral histories. Like I said we've got over 1,000 on the website and there's a lot of material out there, great material waiting to be mined.  Host: Wow. Please do.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Thank you so much.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Thank you.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey thanks for sticking around. Once again and so we can sort of tie the bow on this episode, we are in the middle of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo missions. Of course today's episode being just before the landing on the—the historic landing on the moon, July 20th 1969, 50 years later.

Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 258, “Moon Farming.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. As we planned ahead farther into space than any human has ever gone before, one of the key questions is, how will we ensure humans survive. And a component of this question is, what are we going to eat? If you've seen the movie “The Martian,” you probably have somewhat of an idea of just how important plants are for the survival of humans on Mars. The extent to which plants can be a key aspect to an astronaut's diet on a deep space mission depends heavily on the success of growing and sustaining plants in space. Before we jump straight ahead to the Red Planet, scientists took a closer look at the lunar surface and recently, using Moon soil collected during the Apollo missions, successfully grew plants. On this episode, we have two special guests joining us to talk about their recent groundbreaking discovery. First, we have Dr. Rob Ferl from the University of Florida, currently serves as assistant vice president for research and as a distinguished professor. He served as a University of Florida faculty member for over 40 years and has received numerous awards for his research, including the NASA Exceptional Public Service Medal for his contributions to the space community that he received this year. Joining the podcast for a second time we have Dr. Anna-Lisa Paul, who is the director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida, and a research professor in the department of horticulture sciences there where she studies the responses of plants to novel environments with a focus on the environments and its impacts on space exploration. She's performed at least ten experiments in space over the past 20 years, as well as in analog environments on aircraft, suborbital vehicles, and extreme terrestrial environments in the Canadian High Arctic and in Antarctica. In 2019 Paul received the NASA Medal of Honor for Exceptional Scientific Achievement, and she was inducted as a Fellow of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research. Two exceptional individuals and we’re lucky to have them both on this podcast. With that, let's get right into it. Enjoy.    [Music]  Host: Anna-Lisa and Rob, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.    Anna-Lisa Paul: Wow, thanks for having us. This is great.    Rob Ferl: Yeah, we appreciate being here and the opportunity to talk about our projects just generally is a lot of fun, so thanks for having us.    Host: Yeah, absolutely. And this is coming really on the heels of, I mean, I, I was so excited to see that Web feature come out that it, it, wonderful title, you know, like, we, we grew plants in, in lunar soil. That's, that's amazing. I want to, that's really going to be the, what we're going to be talking about today is this experiment, what led up to it and everything. But I want to first, by gauging just, you know, how that felt? I, I'm, from what I understand, this was something that was in the works for a long time, and, and that moment, you know, whenever you successfully did it, and then we were able to publicize this to the world, I want to know just your thoughts, just, and, and all the hard work that, that got put into that. Anna-Lisa, we'll start with you. Just, do you have, did you have any immediate emotion or reaction to the success of the experiment?   Anna-Lisa Paul: Well, yes; yes, of course. It's one of those things that when Rob and I were looking at the very first of the sprouts coming out, the realization hits you that we are the first people to see terrestrial organisms growing in extraterrestrial soil, extraterrestrial dirt. I mean, how cool is that? So it was an, an incredibly emotional experience. And I know Rob can say more on that subject for sure.    Rob Ferl: One of the things you have to appreciate, and I think most people do appreciate, is that even though we've had lunar soil samples for a long, long time -- for 50 some years -- the, the chance for biologists, true biologists, dirty, plain old stick things in the dirt and let them grow biologists, for us to have an opportunity to work with those precious lunar samples was by itself an amazing thing. And, you know, it, it took literally years for us to be able to get them and a lot of proposalizing and preparation to make it happen. So not only was there the, sort of like the just bald-faced joy of seeing plants growing in extraterrestrial soil and lunar soil, there was also the tremendous release and relief from having worked on something for, you know, 15 years in order to get to that point. So there was, there's a, there's a lot involved and a lot that we could unpack about the conduct of science in this business. And really, truly, the fun, the joy of, of doing this kind of science, doing space biology in a way that is so, well, biologically meaningful.    Host: Yeah. And, and that's exactly that, Rob, is, is what I want to explore, because it truly, from what, from what I understand this really was something that, that took a long time. It was, it was a long time in the making and it all came together. I want to start by exploring your guys' expertise and relationship, because, you know, this was, from what I could tell to both of you, it was a very meaningful and I know you dedicated much of your career to this pursuit. So, so Anna-Lisa, I'll start with you, to, give us a sense of, of what your expertise is and give us a hint of how you and Rob came together to start thinking about working on growing plants in, in lunar soil?    Anna-Lisa Paul: Well, I am a plant molecular biologist, but I also have a strong background in biology and also physiological ecology. So in other words, how, how do plants respond to the environments in which they live and, and how do they garner the resources to give to the rest of us in those environments. And so, for me, I was really always very interested in, in how plants work and how plants do the things they do in extraordinary situations and things. And the notion of how plants respond to novel environments is extraordinarily appealing because it's outside their evolutionary experience. And so working in some kind of environment that they have never seen, like spaceflight, is then sort of the next ultimate kind of step, and that's where, that's where the expertise comes together in the kind of work that Rob and I have, have done both in spaceflight but also in what we would call exploration environments like in the Antarctic or in the, in the High Canadian Arctic, and learning to apply some of our different perspectives is what really made for a great team.    Host: So you're no stranger to adventure, Anna-Lisa, and this just happened to be the next frontier for you.    Anna-Lisa Paul: That's well said.   Host: [Laughter] Now, now Rob, you, you share this, this passion for pursuing, you know, this, the -- other worlds and, and, and, you know, working with Anna-Lisa, how'd you guys end up on this same project?    Rob Ferl: We, we share a number of, of interests, including basically what happens to organisms when they experience strange and novel environments. I'm a, I'm a geneticist by training, I, I grew up in the era of understanding what DNA does and how genes work and how, how the internal metabolic toolbox of organisms allows them to grow, survive, become different things and, and make decisions about their life's trajectory. And in fact I, I, I grew most of my scientific teeth by trying to understand inside the nucleus of a cell how a gene works and what makes it work and why it's important that genes work, and it, you know, that's led us to this collaboration where Anna-Lisa knows a lot more about plants than I do and I know a little bit more about DNA, maybe, than she does. But, but what I have is also a sort of this, sort of engineering adventure sense that, that I share with Anna-Lisa with regards to doing stuff that's not easy. Part of, part of what creates a lot of the fun in our science is doing the stuff, doing spaceflight stuff, doing, you know, survival stuff is by nature difficult. How you get a hold of stuff like lunar soil is not for everybody, it's hard to figure out. How you grow plants in space doesn't just mean sending some seeds up and saying, OK do it. There's a, there's a lot of sort of non-scientific engineering technology think, there's a lot of sort of outside your swim lane thinking that goes on, and part of that, I have to say is, is the opportunity to participate, to be, to be a, to be an active member, to be, for example, talking with the astronauts, being able to go to Antarctica and not just ask somebody to analyze your plants there but do the analysis yourself. So the experiential part of, of our kind of science is, again, I think something that we share as a team and our various, sort of educational upbringings allow us to contribute different perspectives to these kinds of projects. And, and this is one very good one where, one very good example of that, where, where sort of our collective expertise was able to draw upon things like geology, technology, the history of spaceflight, the Apollo era, the interest in Moon landings: all of that stuff came together in a very nice way here.    Host: Yeah, it seems that way. And, and I do want to explore all those, those aspects of that, but, Rob, I'm locking onto one thing you said in just the challenges of, of -- it's hard to do something like this. And Anna-Lisa, you might have a, a little bit more insight into this because from what I understand, you know, this is not the first really attempt to try to use lunar soil to, to grow something. From, from what I understand this is, scientists were attempting this back when we first retrieved the Apollo samples and the, the lunar regolith back in the, in the 60s and 70s. And so, I wonder if we can start with a little history lesson by, by exploring what had been done in the past that maybe we learned from that, that that was applied to this particular experiment?     Anna-Lisa Paul: Absolutely. And so, one of the things is that, actually, plants never have been grown in lunar regolith before. This is the very first. Back in the day, and Rob and I talked with Charles Walkinshaw, who's one of the scientists who worked back in the lunar receiving facility back in the day, in the Apollo era. They introduced lunar regolith to plants; they, they rubbed their leaves with it, they sprinkled it gently on top of them as the plants were growing in normal terrestrial materials. But primarily it was just to test as to whether there was anything deadly, anything infectious that could be transferred from the lunar regolith to biological organisms, to terrestrial organisms. And so while plants were very important to the, the, the processes of understanding the, the dangers of lunar regolith, they were never actually grown in it with the notion of it could be a support matrix for growing them like you would grow in, in regular soil. And, and we've done a lot of research when we first started looking into what it would be like to try to do this, including going to the old archives, the, the hard copy archives in, in Houston, and, and, and Rob can tell you a little more about that story, which is really pretty fascinating.    Rob Ferl: So if, if you, for those of us that are old enough and can think back to the Apollo era, we all have to remember that the return of lunar samples was for that era generating a lot of the discussion that we might be hearing and have heard a little bit about with regard to bringing Martian soil, Martian samples, back to Earth now.  In other words, will we be introducing extraterrestrial harmful organisms into our terrestrial environment? The movie “The Andromeda Strain” was coming out at the same time as the Apollo landings were taking place, and NASA was very serious about what's called backward containment. In other words, they didn't want the lunar soil samples to negatively impact the terrestrial biology. That's why the astronauts were, were quarantined inside of a trailer for a few weeks, and that's why up and through Apollo 14 the astronauts, their samples, their soils, their, their, even their spacecraft were, were quarantined just in case there was a bad bug that would come back from the Moon. Plants, animals, fungi at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory, there was an entire army of scientists dedicated from, say, 1960…something they built the Lunar Receiving Lab, all the way through the early 70s: a lot of science was done where lunar samples were rubbed on to terrestrial organisms to see if any bacteria or viruses would transmit from the Moon to the Earth. That didn't happen. Lunar soil, lunar rocks were all deemed to be safe with no biotoxic organisms in them. But after that, the samples were locked down, they were made pristine, kept pristine, so that geology and the main goal of lunar science -- in other words, understanding the Moon -- was the top priority. Interactions with biology went into the background at that point.    Host: So then, when you guys were thinking about, you know, you know, you spent some time looking at plants in microgravity and in the space environment; I guess I'll direct this to Anna-Lisa: what, what made you think that, that sort of now, or, or whenever you started the experiment if you can give us an insight into that, that it was the right, the right time to, to attempt this particular experiment?    Anna-Lisa Paul: Well, I think that every, everybody has this notion that eventually we're going to be going back to the Moon, going to explore past our, our corner of the solar system, take our plants off Earth. And when you think about it, plants are really what enable us to be true explorers, to be able to explore past the limits of what you can just bring with you in terms of supplies. And so, we knew, we, meaning me and Rob, but we, meaning also the community, that if we're going to understand how to use in situ resources, resources that would be available to us on the surface of the Moon or the surface of Mars, in a greenhouse, for instance, we have to do a lot of homework to understand what that looks like first. And so, back ten, 15 years ago now, we started doing those experiments with simulants. And so, we used a, Johnson Space Center simulants that are supposed to be very akin to what you would find on the surface of the Moon, at least in some of the, the areas. And could you grow plants in that? And a lot of people have done that, that work of looking at how could simulants be used to at least practice what it would be like to grow plants in a lunar greenhouse losing, using that kind of regolith. And we found very quickly that it's not as easy as just putting some in a pot and plopping in a seed. And so we spent a number of years, first of all, figuring out how could you do it really well with the simulants, and then the next step of course, was how would you do it with the real stuff? So about ten years ago, we put in our first proposal, and as Rob sort of mentioned earlier the, the, the folks at the lunar Allocation Analysis Review Board looked at it and said, yeah, you know, these biologists: they'll get it all messy, you know, it won't be pristine anymore. We, we can't have that. Why would they think that that would be a good idea? Now, of course, they didn't say any of those things, they were just very polite and saying, yeah, well, thanks for applying, but, you know. So to make a long story short, we, we've applied a few more times and each iteration we learned more and more about how doing it well with the simulants, how to do it in smaller and smaller amounts, and so, at the end of the day in 2019, we applied very precisely for a particular type of material, we asked for materials from Apollo 17 that were sort of all jumbled together, stuff that Harrison Schmitt scooped out of the fender of the rover, and so we thought, nah, you know, no self-respecting geologist would really want to play with that stuff anyway, so they could give it to us. And so, the proposal was, and now in 2019, very well-received because not only was it the time, we're going now back to the Moon as, as a peoples, right, and so the, the pristine materials that we're collecting from the Apollo era, there's end in sight to think two things. One is that, well, yeah, maybe we really do need to understand how plants can grow, but also we are probably going to be able to get more. And so it's not quite so scary to give some to a biologist to get all, to get all messy. And at this point, I should hand it over to Rob for the rest of the story.   Host: Yeah. Yeah. Rob, you talked about the difficulties of acquiring the samples.    Rob Ferl: Yeah. So the, the, the spirit of everything Anna-Lisa has, has nicely laid out for you, there's, there's some additional things though that, that are, that are worth considering when we talk about, well, why, why was now a good time. And, and it is a sort of a pretty complex, I think, set of societal and scientific reasons why, why it came to happen. First off is, yeah, we got, we got better at our proposals in using smaller amounts and our research ideas got increasingly compelling, just like what would happen in any scientific proposal endeavor. But I have to tell you also that, that groups like the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group, it began about 15 years ago to talk about biology on the Moon as well, and that was at the, at the beginnings of the inklings that yes, science and people were going to go back to the Moon. So the community began waking up to the idea of biology going back to the Moon and us needing to understand what would happen to biology when it came in contact with the Moon. The community it, sort of writ large, began to think about that seriously about, about 15, 18 years ago. And certainly by 12 years ago, as Anna-Lisa mentioned, when, when we went to do some serious background work on what was accomplished in the Lunar Receiving Lab -- in other words, to truly understand whether or not, well, to understand deeply what happened to plants as they came in contact with bits of lunar samples -- first off, I had a break off here for a quick second to say, you know, that was just a blast. Literally, the people that are the archivists there were just wonderful to us. They actually found film for us that was frozen, and they unfroze the film, they digitized it for us so that we could have, we could have first real glimpse of what was happening to the plants and the plant scientists inside the Lunar Receiving Lab back in 1969, ’70, ‘71. So we, we got to, almost 50 years later, 40 years later at that point, we got to unpack the science that was done and then sort of largely forgotten about. So we got to unpack all that right during this time in this era when, when lunar science, sort of largely speaking, was waking up to the idea that, yeah, we need to, we the collective, we need to understand what happens to biology on the Moon. So the community was waking up, the science was sort of being reinvigorated and, I think Anna-Lisa hit it on the head when she said as soon as, as soon as there was a larger commitment to the Artemis program when we would be going back, the, the ability to relinquish some of those samples for biological purposes began to make a lot of sense. And we just happened to be there at the right time. Maybe not “happened to be there,” we planned to be there at the right time. But basically it was a nice confluence of, of us maturing our science ideas, the Artemis program, with the promise of replacing anything that we might ruin in terms of, in terms of lunar samples, and the need to understand what happens to biology if we’re going to the Moon for longer periods of time.    Host: So Anna-Lisa, I want to further understand, you know, that the timing seemed to work out and there was this, there was this pitch in 2019 where the, the, the lunar folks, the lunar sample curation folks said, hey, it's, it's, we're going to say yes to this, and I wonder, I wonder what was the approach, the design of the experiment itself that, that really sold this community on, on allowing you to, to use the, the lunar soil? Can you talk about the approach that went into how you were going to execute this experiment?    Anna-Lisa Paul: Well, the, the approach was pretty much the same as that we had pitched in the past, in that we, we developed a system, a growth system, that, that was formed on these tiny culture plates that essentially you could use as little as 900 milligrams of material. That's about a fifth of a teaspoon of lunar regolith that you can grow a single Arabidopsis plant in. And the, the other thing that we did is, is we had a colleague here at the University of Florida, Stephen Elardo, who's a geologist who has also worked with lunar samples. And so we developed a good proposal on, on how to be good stewards of, of lunar material, how to, to preserve the material the best that we can, as opposed to, you know, just flinging around willy-nilly into the little ceramic pots or something. I mean, we had a very clearly-defined mechanism by which we would use the material, preserve the material, archive the material, and make sure that the regolith that we were entrusted with was, was taken care of very well. And so that was one of the things that we learned in our earlier proposals that was profoundly important to the, to the review board. We also were in a very good position because Rob and I have used Arabidopsis now in a number of different -- well at this time, like ten different -- spaceflight experiments that we also had very well characterized the responses of Arabidopsis at the molecular level to these other novel environments, and had practiced the basics even in greenhouses in the Arctic at that, at that time using in situ materials up there. So it all came together, I think, very perfectly to, to make the perfect storm of a proposal, to demonstrate that we had all the kinks worked out, we had all the background material as far as plants responding at, at, in spaceflight and other exploration environments, that made the, the, the, the final key piece of information about going back to the Moon was plants was in our hands, and this is the way we had to do it.    Host: So if I'm, if I'm reading that back right, Anna-Lisa, it sounds like the Arabidopsis you had, you had refined techniques for growing in, in, in different, you know, harsher environments, which really helped to say that this is a, this is a plant, from what I understand it's a, it's a plant that's easier to grow in, in, you know, it's a very robust sort of plant, but then you also had a lot of data it sounds like to compare it to. So it's not just, it sounds like this experiment goes beyond just, can we do it?  Anna-Lisa Paul: Oh yeah.  Host: Right. You obviously want to, you want to compare it to, to other models. So, so it seemed like that was sort of the, the reason why you picked this plan.    Anna-Lisa Paul: Oh, yeah. That's very true. Arabidopsis thaliana is the model organism for plants. And not only have Rob and I done a ton of, of work with Arabidopsis in spaceflight and other analog environments, so has the rest of the world. And so we could take the, so we use it as a control. We use this JSC-1 stimulant. And so, all of the comparisons, both in growth morphology and also molecular responses, the gene expression patterns, were compared to the, the, the lunar simulant that was growing right beside them in these same, in these same culture plates. And what we could do then is we could take the, the patterns of gene expression that was different between the simulants and each of the different Apollo sites and ask, what does that look like in terms of what we see in terrestrial stresses? And again, Arabidopsis has been used around the world for all manner of different stress responses, and so when we took those abundance of databases of molecular responses to, say, high salt stress, to heavy metal stress, to drought, to anything, because Arabidopsis has been used this way we can say, oh, look at that: you know, half the genes that are being expressed are associated with reactive oxygen species and the other third are associated with heavy metal responses, and so we could use all the data that's out there for Arabidopsis to compare what's going on in the samples we were doing.    Host: So Rob, in terms of your, your expertise on the genetic level and looking at the gene expression based on what, what stressors were being introduced by using this particular soil, it sounds like, sounds like you had a lot of, you had your techniques as well pretty refined and you would just use those, you would use that standard, those standard techniques that you used for, for a lot of other experiments and that the community was very used to, and just have this new dataset with what's happening with lunar soil.    Rob Ferl: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's pretty much exactly true.  But it sort of, sort of under, underappreciates the, the entire role of Arabidopsis here. For one thing, Arabidopsis is a very small plant and that's, that's one of the reasons why the logic behind using it in spaceflight sort of makes it collinear to the logic of using it for lunar, lunar sample growth. When we fly an experiment to the International Space Station, for example, volume is limited, and in order to have very many plants you are better off having smaller plants that can do a lot of their growth cycle in just a few weeks. And so you can sample a lot of biology, understand a lot of what happens in their metabolic tool chest, on orbit or in a small growth chamber with a little bit of lunar soil to support their growth. So, so the, the notion of Arabidopsis, and the power of Arabidopsis in, in this particular point, is really, is really truly worth appreciating. But getting back to your main point, your question there, yeah, the ability to use widely recognized tools for understanding what genes plants are expressing in a given environment lets us understand what it takes for plants to live in that environment. And that's why, as Anna-Lisa mentioned, some of the responses we saw in the plants growing in lunar soil, those informants of what their cells, what their nuclei, are doing to allow them to live in that environment -- she mentioned heavy metals and metal stresses and salt stresses -- these are all hallmarks of certain sort of metabolic responses that we can now seek to understand by comparing them to all the other databases that have already been mentioned. But one thing that's important to recognize from this is that we, we are informed by all those previous experiments, but it's important to recognize that nothing's ever been grown in lunar soil before. So when we interpret those data -- oh, we see salt stress it must be a salty environment, or we see metal stress, oh, that must be the nanophase iron in the lunar soils that don't appear here on Earth -- that's probably too simple of an interpretation, and I think Anna-Lisa would agree that we generally wonder, sort of how does, how does terrestrial biology react in an extraterrestrial environment for which there is no evolutionary preparedness? Would their reactions, would their gene expression patterns, make sense? Would they be somehow differently informed by misinterpreting what's going on in the environment? For example, the nanophase iron that's present in lunar samples; does that create an iron reaction in these plants or does it create something different? So we're at the front edge of really trying to understand what all those gene expression data tell us about the lunar environment, because this is our first encounter with it. And we have to, we have to look at, we have to interpret, we have to wonder, whether all of our data are sort of to be interpreted literally, or do they need to be interpreted as a, as a novel response to a place they've never been before?   Host: Interesting. OK. I want to, I want to explore a little bit about, OK, so, so we're, we're, we're getting a better understanding of part of the experiment is, you know, growing these plants in this, in this soil, what, what are the stresses, and using the gene expression maybe to, to identify what those stresses are.  And it sounds, you know, it sounds like you guys are going to take a pretty deep dive, but I want to, from my own, you know, I'm, I'm not, definitely not a biologist, but I'm going to go ahead and assume that you're not just going to put a seed in lunar soil and put a light on it, water it a little bit and see what happens. I think, I would assume there's a, there's a, there's this element of maybe putting in some additives to help it grow, and then I wonder when, when we first started talking about the soil, we talked about these early Apollo experiments where we were rubbing soil on plants to see if there was any bad things in there. And I wonder in this experiment was there any, anything from the soil that you knew was bad and maybe perhaps you removed ahead of time to help it be successful? Anna-Lisa, can you talk about what went into actually helping the, what'd you do to actually grow the plants?    Anna-Lisa Paul: So, so we knew, for instance, that from our experience when growing in, in the simulant, there's no, or there's very few nutrients that are available to the plant. And so we knew from our past experience that we'd have to give them a little bit of, I guess what you would call dilute fertilizer in order for them to grow at all. Otherwise, they're just not going to grow past sort of this, the two-leaf stage, and then they would just die. So we gave everybody, and that includes the, the, the JSC-1 controls and all the, the, the three different lunar sites, a little bit of a nutrient solution just to help them survive on there. Now we knew that there were going to be differences between the, the simulant and the lunar regolith simply because by the nature of it. The lunar regolith has never been, of course, exposed to the wind, to the rain, or any kind of weathering, and so those materials are profoundly sharp and reactive and, and lots of surface areas and, and porous bits and knobs and stuff in that material, that is very, very different than even the harshest volcanic ash that you can find on the surface of the, the Earth. So we knew there were going to be challenges. What we didn't fully realize is what the extent of those challenges would be, and what kind of strategies that the plants would mount against those impediments. And so, in addition to looking at the, the gene expression patterns of, of how they respond to the, to the different regolith, we also could see when, well, we, we, we grew them in little sets of four, we planted about four seeds on each one of the, the, the replicated samples, and eventually after about a week we wanted to thin them out and to let only one single plant be growing in each one of those little tiny micro pots. And we noticed as we pulled out the, the materials to be thinned, that the roots of the standing plants, the plants that we, we pulled out of the regolith, were sort of shorter and, and stockier, and, and, and they looked like they'd been really struggling to get into the regolith, compared to the relatively long and slender roots that went from the, the, the JSC-1 controls, the terrestrial materials. And so even from the get-go we realized that, that plants were struggling with some of the physical features of the regolith that made it a more of a challenge for them to grow because they, it was just, it was just hard.  You know, think about the difference between walking across, you know, sharp stickers versus walking across cool grass.    Host: Yeah, that's, I, I'm, my feet are hurting just thinking about it, so I, I can, I can only imagine what the, what the plants were going through. OK. So, so yeah, you're going to be, you're going to be looking at some of that data, of course, and, and, and I wonder, well, let's, let's focus on that actually, let's go back to it, Anna-Lisa. Do you have an early interpretation of, because ultimately, you talked about, we, you know, the, this, this soil, this, this lunar regolith is, is sharp, it's, it's, is harsh, but somehow it, it, it worked its way through these stressors and, and we saw Arabidopsis come through. So from your, from your expertise of doing this with different simulants and different harsh environments, what do you, what, what's your going-in theory and what are, what are you planning on investigate, on, from, from your perspective, from your biological perspective, that will give us a sense of how this is happening?    Anna-Lisa Paul: OK. OK. So there's two, two parts to that.   Host: OK.  Anna-Lisa: So, for the first part, think about this, how do we, how do we know that they're harsher? How, how do we know that, that, that, that is some, some aspects are different, more difficult than others? We, in the study we use three different sites: we use Apollo 11, Apollo 12, and Apollo 17, so those are three different areas from the Moon. And those three areas are actually quite different. And so, just to bring it down to, for instance, between Apollo 11 and Apollo 12, Apollo 11 is much older. And so the maturity of those regoliths is how a geologist would call it, those regoliths are more mature: they've been exposed to the solar winds, for instance, for almost a billion years longer, and during that time they've been more suffused with the, for instance, the nanophase iron, the metallic iron that Rob mentioned earlier. They've gotten more sharp, more sharp glasses, more surface area fractures and things, and so those materials should be worse than the Apollo 11 materials, which are much younger, less mature. And in fact that's what we saw. And so if you look at the plants that grew in Apollo 11 mature, lunar regolith versus the Apollo 12 lunar regolith, the, the plants are happier growing in the Apollo 12, they have fewer genes that are differentially expressed in, as a stress response, and so those data themselves say to us that, that the harshness of the regolith is something that we can both predict and perhaps ameliorate. And that's one of the things you were asking earlier: so what are you going to do about this stuff, and how are you going to make it less harsh, and what, what do you see for the future? Because yeah, you're not just going to put a shovel of it into your greenhouse on this lunar surface and, and call it a day. So anytime, the minute that you add water, the minute you add air, you are already starting to change the regolith because the, those edges are getting, going from those sharp, prickly things to getting their edges rounded off a little bit. Anytime you grow something into it, the first generation of plants that grew in that regolith were struggling, but the next generation that grows in it will have had that regolith be conditioned by the plants that grew in it before. And if you're really planning on growing true crops and things, you're not going to be limited to doing a very precise, scientific experiment, you're going to be able to say, dig in organic materials and really stir that stuff up and, and ameliorate some of the sharp surfaces and difficulties that roots will have growing in that because you'll put additives in it that'll make it a far more conducive environment for plants to grow. And so that's going to be the next steps before you actually do this on the surface of a Moon greenhouse.    Host: OK. Very insightful, Anna-Lisa. Thank you. Now, Rob, you mentioned the, you're at the very beginning of understanding the gene expression and looking into it. Can you tell me some of the next steps that you're going to be taking and your perspective on what do you hope to find out, what do you hope to investigate over the next couple of months, years, to learn more from this experiment?  Rob Ferl: There are, there are just so many kinds of things and kinds of questions that can be asked and, and it's, and it is worth, it's worth investigating some of these just at a very top level. Right now, we have in our laboratory lunar samples that were in the presence of biological species -- the Arabidopsis plants -- for several weeks. This is the first time biology's been introduced into lunar soil samples. What, what kind of questions, what kind of changes have occurred in that, in those regolith samples that indicate biology was there? Would, would it not be an interesting astrobiology question to, to simply ask, OK, what sort of signals did biology leave behind? Wouldn't it be interesting to know whether or not there are biosignatures, clear biosignatures, that are now in that regolith simply because the plants grew there? In a related way, we grew these plants in a laboratory setting here on the Earth that was not biosafety standard, it wasn't sterile environment by any means. Back in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory, when plants were sort of dusted and sprinkled with lunar soil samples, those, those experiments were done in gloveboxes where human interaction, human microbes, for example, would not contaminate the sample. When we grew these plants we grew them in a shirtsleeve environment that we sort of anticipated would be not unlike the shirtsleeve environment of a lunar laboratory when samples were brought in from the outside. So not only have these lunar samples been in contact with plants, they've been also in contact with whatever microbes are floating around in our laboratory or off from our clothes or our skin. And so therefore, again, we have to sort of wonder what's the bioecology now of those lunar soils? And by the way, now that biology has been in contact with the regolith, I think we can legitimately call it lunar soil. And geologists would have an interesting little discussion about that. So, so very, very sort of specifically, if you turn, just turn it on its head for a little bit, there's a lot of questions that can be asked about these lunar soils now simply because they were in the presence of plants and terrestrial biology microbes for a few weeks. This, this, this really presents some interesting thoughts from sort of the non-plant biological sciences perspective. But, but back to the, the directionality of your questions, in other words, what are sort of the next steps from, from, from where we are now, there are a number of things that are really interesting to think about. For a while I think we're going to be limited to growing small plants and probably Arabidopsis. A lot of people would like to see what a radish does, what a corn plant does or something like that. But the, but those seeds and those plants are so much bigger it would take a serious, seriously, large commitment of lunar dirt to make that happen. But what we can do is, what we can do is, is ask what sort of genetic variation would be useful in growing plants in the existing lunar soil. For example, we could take Arabidopsis mutants in various kinds of genes that have to do with getting back to what we've learned, salt tolerance or heavy metal tolerance, or other sorts of things that would allow plants by their genetic nature to thrive even better than they did. So that's, that's another direction that we could head. But for the, for the time being, the real question is going to be back to Anna-Lisa's point: if you grow now the next crop and the crop after that, using the same plants, does, does biology condition the soil well enough, better, make it easier for the next generation of plants to go there? And, and before I forget, I just wanted to also mention that sort of a human element here…just, just think for yourself, just anybody think, if you were given the opportunity to do something for the very first time, very first time, what, what would you do? How much nutrients would you add? How, how much light would you use? How much any of these kinds of things would you do? And, and the question is, boy, if we had to do it all over again I'm not sure what we would do different, but there are a few things that we would look at. And some of them have to do with the conditioning of the samples as, as you've mentioned. One of the things we found fairly early on was that the different lunar samples that accepted water differently, they wetted differently; I think that's, that is a really interesting phenomenon that basically would take some physical work to make sure that water interacted well with the samples. So as, as, as the scientific community sort of absorbs what we've done so far, I think we're going to see all sorts of interesting proposals for what to do next.    Host: Very interesting. So on this, on this, this theme of next steps, Anna-Lisa, I'll go to you: it seems like, is it fair to, to maybe hope that maybe in the near term one of the next steps that, that you can, that you can take is to, to further this experiment by exploring and maybe using those same samples, lunar samples, that you acquired, but just try it again with a different plant or maybe the same plant and see what happens with the reuse of soil? Is that perhaps, maybe a, a near term goal for you to explore beyond just looking at this experiment?    Anna-Lisa Paul: Absolutely.  Host: Very good.  Anna-Lisa: That's an easy one; in the works.  Host: In the works. Fantastic. That's really good to hear. Now, now we explored in the beginning of this chat a little bit about the timing of this, you know, like why now? Part of it is really this, the, the Artemis program that's, that's right around the corner. We're going to be launching here soon, Artemis I is, it's supposed to be a continuing program, and with that, comes regular presence on the lunar surface, where we could potentially and, and very likely, be acquiring more and more samples, which I think is very exciting for the scientific community, and I'm sure, I'm sure from you guys as well. From your perspective, what, and, and from, for your research, what does the Artemis program open up for you in terms of possibilities to, you know, you mentioned already just the differences in some of the lunar samples from these different sites, now we're talking about future sites, I mean, I think to, to me, I would think that opens up a world of opportunity, but for you guys, but, and Anna-Lisa, I'll, I'll go to you first, what, what excites you about the, the opportunities that are presented by, by having this Artemis program and, and, and potentially very soon, getting new samples?    Anna-Lisa Paul: Oh yeah, absolutely. Getting, getting new samples from, from different sites would be amazingly valuable also to add to the, to the data of, of what, what the impact of different types of regolith has on plant growth. But also, from the perspective of, since, since part of the Artemis program is to have a presence on the Moon, that not only bringing back samples but will be extraordinary is taking the seeds to the, the lunar surface itself. And I don't mean, of course, tossing them outside the airlock but, you know, growing them in a microhabitat inside the lunar habitat that the astronauts will be occupying. And we could very easily, for instance, set up astronauts with the same kind of micro form factor, and you could grow the same experiment, even, almost in the palm of your hand, but using the lunar gravity itself. So there's a lot of things that can be done now that the Moon is opening up a little bit more to the next generation of scientists. And yeah, we were the first to do this kind of stuff on the Earth, but we certainly won't be the last and it's going to be, been taken over by a lot of people who might actually do it on the Moon.    Host: Well, that's really exciting. And I feel like, you know, it, it, to me it, it, it kind of continues from there. You're talking about bringing samples back, you're talking about growing things on the Moon. I feel, to me, it seems like the, the more that we do this, the more refined our techniques can be until maybe, you know, in a future Artemis mission, you know, if, if you keep trying this, if you keep experimenting, we could be, you know, we could have, like, small farms on the Moon that could supply at least a little bit of nutrients on the Moon. But to me this pursuit really helps us to get to Mars as well. And I feel like the more we do this, the more we try things on the Moon, the more we experiment in these harsh environments, the better equipped we are to create farms for the journey to Mars, on the deep space transport that's going to, that's going to carry humans all the way to the Red Planet, and then ultimately on the surface of Mars, dealing with Martian soil and figuring out the challenges there, you know? I know there's one of the things is like, perchlorates, for example, you have to figure that out. But I feel like if you do it on the lunar soil, you know, it really helps, you have more data that can maybe be applied to growing it successfully on, on Mars. Rob, I'll go to you first. Do, do you feel the same way? Do you feel like this opens up avenues for deeper and deeper space exploration and, and the more we do it the more, the more science we do in support of growing plants in these harsh environments, the better equipped we are for a journey to Mars?    Rob Ferl: So the simple answer is, yeah, I agree. The, the, the longer answer gets just a little bit complicated and, and nuanced in the way that that Anna-Lisa mentioned, and that is, as we, the collective we, start thinking about bigger, longer operations, we are, we're talking about humans doing this stuff. It becomes a, a human endeavor. And plants are there, yeah, to provide food, they're there, yeah, to provide some science there, they're there, yeah, to renew our oxygen and sort of clean up our water, do all the things they do here on Earth. That's why it's important always to remember that, you know, we, wherever we're going to go we're going to create some sort of ecosystem and putting plants in that ecosystem to do for us on Mars what they do for us here on the Earth makes abundant sense. But the nuanced part of this is that with humans going and with, going with enough capability, the science that we would like to do can be done on the way, it can be done there, and samples won't have to come back. You know, the whole “Mark Watney colonizing Mars” thing is way more real than I think people can truly appreciate. The notion that, that we will send plant biologists as well as some seeds when we go to these places is, it's a very real think. And it's, it's, and the, what I celebrate about our current era is that we are talking about sending people, and enough people and for a long enough period of time, so that when we envision in our laboratory what a lunar plant science laboratory might look like, it's not pure science fiction anymore. It's, it's very possible. And when we think about growing plants on the space station as a model for what the transit vehicle plants might look like, it's not just fiction anymore. It's, it's very possible; it's very real. The kinds of things that we're doing now will support the scientists, the plant scientists, the people that make these voyages. So yeah, I agree completely, and I think that it's part of what makes all of this such an enthralling kind of science to do the, the human element.    Host: You're making it sound very real, Rob. And, and, I think that, I mean, I think that's your intent is to show, is to share just how, how real this is, and to your point, not just to science fiction. Anna-Lisa, I wonder if you have the same sense. And you know, I, I, I feel like you'd be the perfect person, I'd throw your name in the hat to go to the Moon and try and try some of this, try some, of growing some crops on the Moon yourself. But I wonder if your, if your level of excitement matches Rob's?    Anna-Lisa Paul: Oh yeah. Unquestionably. I mean this is why we do what we do. I mean, this is, humans are explorers and it's, it's an amazing opportunity and privilege to, to be able to make it so.  Host: Yeah. And you, both of you are contributing so much to the scientific community in, in order to do that. It's, I, I, I'm very excited to be talking with both of you today because you did something brand new, you grew plants in, in lunar soil. And it's, this has been to me amazingly informative to get to talk to you both and, and talk about what went into it, but not only that and just, just lead to what comes next and it's, it just sounds so very exciting. So, Anna-Lisa and Rob, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast and, and, and, letting us in on some of the, the efforts that went into your work. Huge congratulations to the both of you for, for the success of the experiment, and it sounds like you're, you're not even close to done. Sounds like there's, there's a lot more to do. A lot more to find out and, and I think that's equally exciting. So thanks again to you both.    Anna-Lisa Paul: No, thank you, thank you very much.  Rob Ferl: Yep. It’s been a privilege to be a part. We appreciate it.  [Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

Jessica Vos: Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here in this different capacity this time.  Host: All right, let's set the stage. Because I want people to understand what is WELL, your organization? What does it do here at JSC?  Jessica Vos: Absolutely. So at JSC we are really lucky in that our leadership truly believes that employees are our greatest asset. Mainly because of the fact that their diverse experiences backgrounds and skills that they each bring to work every day are truly what make us competitive and successful. Especially in this type of industry. So at JSC we have nine employee resource groups.  Host: Nine.  Jessica Vos: Which is quite a few, yeah. We have nine. And they're all a part of the Inclusion and Innovation Council Initiative, the I&I Council Initiative. And what's really awesome is that the leadership is all made up of employee volunteers. This is a side job for everybody.  Host: Okay.  Jessica Vos: And a side job that we don't get paid for. And rarely thanked for honestly.  Host: Oh, come on.  Jessica Vos: But they do incredible work. Including things like this panel. In general, all the ERGs provide augmented support to the existing management tools and HR systems that are already in place for recruiting and onboarding. Knowledge sharing. Workforce engagement. And employer retention. But we do it that are in ways that are specific to the needs of our membership, the ERG membership.  Host: Okay.  Jessica Vos: So we really want to enable each and every individual employee to be able to bring their authentic selves to work every day and uniquely contribute to the agency's mission.  Host: Now, in a minute here we're going to let people hear a panel presentation that WELL organized. What's the goal in having this event?  Jessica Vos: So you may have been a part of, long-time listeners as you mentioned earlier. You may be familiar with the fact that this year has been really exciting for NASA. There's a couple of things; right?  Host: Yeah.  Jessica Vos: That are huge accomplishments that we're celebrating.  Host: There's something about Apollo.  Jessica Vos: Yeah, something like landing, moon, lunar landing thing. So, yeah, it's been really incredible. And we are doing this as a part of the 50th anniversary events of Apollo 11. And we also wanted to focus on the fact that along with that announcement or along with that celebration, there's been an announcement that we're going back to the moon.  Host: Right.  Jessica Vos: In 2024 with the Artemis mission. So we really want, we are excited about being able to continue the human exploration of deep space in a different way. A more sustainable way. And we realize that that's going to look different and feel different. And require a lot of different methods and technologies than what we had in Apollo. So we thought it would be really neat to have a panel that kind of highlights the legacy of women here at JSC. And how they supported the Apollo program. And how they're currently supporting Artemis and human space flight in general. So this panel is going to touch on one of the main objectives of the I&I Council. Which is really to inspire the next generation and promote the agency's mission. So as we were saying, the incredible accomplishments of the Apollo program were fuelled by the extraordinary efforts of multiple teams of people learning and creating brand new ways to solve problems that had never been approached, right, let alone solved before. So in many ways the team supporting Artemis are in the same boat. Because while the overall goal of getting to the moon is the same as Apollo, the means and objectives of Artemis are quite different. Along with things like the political climate. The international partner engagement. Budgetary constraints. All of the, you know, the whole context in which we're accomplishing this goal now is very different. And for this panel specifically, taking place intentionally on women's equality day, August 26th.  Host: Okay.  Jessica Vos: We wanted to highlight the legacy of women at JSC who supported the Apollo program side by side with the perspectives of the women currently supporting the efforts to advance our ability to achieve future human space flight missions.  Host: Okay, would you do the honors then. Introduce us to the ladies that we're going to hear in the presentation coming up momentarily.  Jessica Vos: Absolutely. So today we're thrilled to have an incredible group of women who bring a really diverse suite of experts, sorry, expertise and experiences to the table. And I'll start off with a very dear friend of mine Dr. Jennifer Rochlis. She is the panel moderator. She brings over 20 years of experience to the table. And has supported many different organizations here on site at JSC. Including the Engineering Directorate, human resources and the Human Health and Performance Directorate. We're also super lucky because she has authored publications and book chapters in the areas of human factors engineering and human systems integration design. Including NASA's very own HSI, Human Systems Integration practitioners guide. She's also the founder and former chair of the HSI ERG who we're co-hosting this event with.  Host: Oh, okay.  Jessica Vos: So she's going to do an incredible job as moderator. We also have, for the first panelist from the Apollo era, is Mary Dunseith Henry. She has served, worked on site through Apollo 7 through Apollo 17. From Apollo 7 through Apollo 17. And she, I'm not going to give it away here. But she has an incredible story to tell that you probably know that includes Apollo 11.  Host: Yeah.  Jessica Vos: Right? And she has a really fun story to tell there. But she supported as a administrative specialist and external relations employee in that time. We also have Dianne Milner who supported here in the Apollo era and still currently works here today.  Host: Oh.  Jessica Vos: She started here back in Mercury.  Host: Goodness.  Jessica Vos: So she may be the longest employee, like, longest employee here.  Host: Badge number two.  Jessica Vos: Yeah, exactly. So we're sure that she's going to have quite a neat perspective to share just from having crossed that many different programs and been here that long. She's really truly seen the highs and lows that NASA has experienced in all of our programs; right? So that will be incredible to hear from her. And then the third Apollo era guest that we have or panelist that west is Estella Hernandez-Gillette. She was supporting the Apollo program as a stenographer and clerk for the engineering directorate. She started in 1964. And she supported, sorry, she was employed here at JSC for 42 years. She's now a professor down at University of Houston. So local. And she also served as the EO director, the equal opportunity office director here at --  Host: Right.  Jessica Vos: JSC for ten years. And then she, when she retired in 2006, she was serving as the deputy of external relations. So very interesting.  Host: Yeah.  Jessica Vos: Background there. And then we have two current panelists, meaning, as in they work here at JSC Today.  Host: Now.  Jessica Vos: And maybe a little bit younger as well. The first one is Dr. Sarah Wallace. She's a microbiologist. And she is the technical lead in our microbiology laboratory here on site. You may recall here name. She, has she done a podcast with you before?  Host: She did. She talked about the genes in space experiment.  Jessica Vos: Right.  Host: Where they identified microbes from start to finish without knowing what they were --  Jessica Vos: Right, DNA sequencing.  Host: In space for the first time.  Jessica Vos: Yeah, so she'll have, she has quite a bit of involvement in how it is that we are mitigating some of those risks for future space flight. Both to moon and beyond.  Host: Right.  Jessica Vos: Hopefully Mars; right? So it will be awesome to hear from her. And then the last panelist will be Miss Ashley White. She is an equal opportunity specialist here at JSC. She has also served as an accountant in JSC's travel office. And a human resource representative in the human resource office. So she has had a few different supporting orgs as well. And she, in general, has a lot of experience working with and supporting the women here at JSC. Both through our ERGs and otherwise. So, yeah, it's going to be a really awesome panel.  Host: All right then, “Women of JSC: Apollo to Artemis.” Here we go.  [ Music ]  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Okay, you guys ready to get started? Okay, Mary, I would love to start with you. Can you tell us what JSC was like when you first got here. And walk us through some of your first day at work.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Well, what JSC was like when I first got here was as exciting as the day that I left. I had come in from, I was working for the Air Force. And because of the Vietnam War my family wanted me back in Houston. So I was transferring from Macon, Georgia. Warner Robins Air Force Base to Ellington Field. But when I got to Ellington to interview, they had a freeze on. And so the young lady at human resources said, you can go to this organization down the road. We don't think it will be here long. But once our freeze is over, you can come back. So I went down the road and was fortunate enough to be hired. And never went back to the Air Force. It was an exciting time. We were a family. There was a large group, but a small group really in comparison to what was going on at the time. And I came right after the fire. So there was lot of mixed emotions going on at that time. And a lot of \"we can do\" going on at that time. And whether you were a secretary. An engineer. An admin. Or the telephone guy. Or the cafeteria. You were all part of a family. And it was a terrific family so.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. [Inaudible] Hello. Got it, okay. Did I get yours, Dianne? You want to check it?  Dianne Milner: Hello.  Jessica Vos: Okay, good. Because I'm going to toss this to you real quickly because Dianne just told us the story of her first day on site. And I thought that was something worth sharing as well.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: I thought I was in prison. I went to the Rich Building that first summer that I worked here. And I didn't have my interim secret clearance yet. So I had to be escorted from the lobby to my desk. And then each trip to the bathroom, she was like a matron, you know, out of, right out of a prison. Would escort me down and wait and then escort me back. So but after that, you know, I got my interim secret clearance. I was all over the warehouse. The lab. Met people. Met my future husband. So I made the best of it after that. It was not a prison any longer.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Ashley, can you tell us a little bit about what brought to you NASA and how you got into the industry?  Ashley White: Sure. Thank you for the opportunity to be on this panel with these illustrious women. So my story is a little different. Back in 2002, I was a sophomore at Prairie View A&M University. And we were having a career fair. And I will never forget it. We were walking around the Baby Dome. That's where the career fair was. And your feet are hurting because you're wearing shoes that you're not used to wearing. And I see the NASA booth. And I go, oh, there's no way, I was an accounting major. They don't want me. That's not for me. But my mother said apply for every opportunity. But nobody was at the table. They had already gone to lunch. So I may or may not have put my resume at the very top of the pile. And I may or may not have stood there for a while and made sure that my resume kept going to the top of the pile. And then I just walked away. Two weeks later I got a call from Anne Roemer saying, hey, would you be interested in a co-op opportunity. And I thought, at NASA? You, like, for, I'm not an engineer. Let me just really make that clear. No, no, no, we have business co-ops. Okay. Two weeks later we were on site. My grandparents had brought me here. But I may have forgotten my license at campus. So, you know, you can't get on site. So I had my interview in Building 110 in one of those back conference rooms. And I started that next week in January 2003. And this is the only company I've ever worked for.  [ Applause ]  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Sarah, I want to ask you a question about your org. And we're going to talk about your work a little bit later. But a lot of times, when we do lessons learned, we focus on what should we do better? And I really like to highlight for sure the things that we're already doing really well. That we want to keep doing really well. And so I want Sarah to talk a little bit about what she feels like in her discipline and her org, what are we doing really well in your mind that we need to keep doing? And that we, others should know?  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Yeah, am I on?  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: You're on.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: All right. So I think that the things we are doing really well is we're, as new folks come in and, you know, we reach out. And we're really starting to work well across organizations. So a lot of the work I have done, I'm within human health and performance. But I've actually been with Astromaterials Research. So across orgs we're really working together. And then another thing we're trying to really do, and I think NASA's doing a great job of this is really communicating to the public what we're doing. So using social media. Using things to really communicate the great things going on here at NASA. All the way from the science to the engineering to the missions. So putting a lot of focus, not just on astronauts, which is so cool. But focus on the stuff we're doing here every day in our labs and in our meetings and various things. It may not be as fun, but we're making that exciting. And we're communicating it to the public. So I see a lot of collaboration going on. A lot of communication. Things that have definitely, I think, gotten so much stronger since I've been here.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. Estella, like to know what advice you have for women here at NASA.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: I'm sorry?  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: What advice you have for women here at NASA. Some advice you have for women here.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: Sorry.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: No, no.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: I'm wearing hearing aids. Can anybody tell? Part of the perils of getting older. Advice for women. Get to know your organizations. Get to know where you are in the organization. And get to know anybody that wants to mentor you. I think it's still a day when we need, everybody needs a mentor. But I think seriously for women, we're still looking for role models and samples of what we want to become. And back in my day, in 1964 when I came here, that was really tough do. Now you have them all around you. I think there's lots of opportunities at NASA, the Johnson Space Center. I can't tell you what a great product I was for opportunity. Just look around you. Look for the opportunity. Get as prepared as you can. Get as many practice opportunities as you can. It's nice to do your job all the time. But give yourself a small percentage of time to go do other things that are other than your job. I think groups like the ERGs, things that are relevant to the Johnson Space Center and to the kind of work that we do, get involved with those. It's great to do a great job. But those involvements will also help you do a better job.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you for that. Dianne, I want to turn to you next. You arrived here sort of the end of the Mercury program. And been here through Gemini. And Apollo. Shuttle. ISS. A really distinguished career. An amazing body of work. You also have seen and experienced a significant number of highs and lows in your time here. Obviously some of the great highs of the Apollo landing and return. And shuttle flights. Also some significant lows in the Apollo 1 fire. And the Challenger and Columbia accidents. When you reflect back on that, can you talk about how you feel that those have really impacted the culture here at JSC. And I'd also like to hear about how you feel like they impacted you personally.  Dianne Milner: Actually, of course, starting back with, I came at the end of Mercury. So, of course, we had never put a human on a booster into space. So that was a stepping stone. We came to Gemini and, gosh, what we learned from Gemini almost losing a vehicle. But attitude control and the, we learned we needed to learn EVA skills. So we came back here and built pools to teach the astronauts. But then the Apollo 1 fire I think was most devastating to me because it was a realization that we can lose precious crew in a flight test on the pad. And not in orbit, you know. So that came home. There was so many things that had to be redone on the command module then. I was told it was almost redesigned. Specifically, no, but no one knew we couldn't use pure oxygen. So then, as we go on, we're learning from our mistakes. We didn't have a lot to work with. If you can imagine no computers. No e-mails. And nothing but short of slide rules and maybe there was a mainframe computer that would now be the size of what's on your desk now. But as we came on, we had, again, lots of success through the station and the shuttle program. And then we had to learn what, you know, we learned on Challenger. So as far as the culture, we went on. We moved on, but we learned. At the precious loss of lives, but we did learn.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Glad to hear that. Mary, also you have seen an amazing amount as well. You were working in the SPAN Room. Which is the spacecraft analysis room for those of you who don't know in the Apollo program mission control office. And you were here from Apollo 7 through 11. Can you talk about some of your most memorable experiences from that time. And I know you mentioned getting here right after Apollo 1. So there was probably quite a change in the pace and things to through that time.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Change in pace.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Well, that as well from, you know, beginning to the end of the Apollo program. And just whatever memorable experiences you'd like to highlight for us in that time for you.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Okay. And just a small correction. When I came on board, I was, got a position in Dave Lang’s directorate, which was Procurement. But then I was assigned to the Apollo program office to work the SPAN Room during missions. Which was very, very exciting. Because you work during the day. You got off at 5:00, and you reported about 6:00. And you got off about 2:00. And then you reported at 8:30 again in the morning. But the most memorable of all of the missions that I did help support would be Apollo 11. When it was kind of new with the president talking to, whoever the president was at the time. Talking from the control center to the astronauts once they were wherever they were. And with 11, when they landed on the moon, of course, President Nixon was our president at that time. And the SPAN Room is a small room off of the control center where a lot of anomalies are taking place. Engineers are in there. Different staff members. And I was the secretarial support for that area at that time. And everybody had gone because, of course, we had landed. And they were waiting for, you know, the first step and that sort of thing. So I was by myself in the SPAN Room. And the phone rang. And when I answered it appropriately like you should, this gentleman was very excited. And said he had to get into the control center. That his calls were not going through. And wanted to know if I knew of some way that he could do that. And so I asked him his name as we would as secretaries. And he said, I'm the president. And I said, yes, sir, but of which company are you the president? So that kind of traveled real quick. When I, and there was nobody there. So I had to put him on hold. So I said, could you please hold a moment, and I will find out what we need to do. So when I came out of the SPAN Room and the control center at that time had little alleyways, I guess, that were going. And at the very end where people couldn't get in was all of the news media. So it came out, secretary puts president on hold. So we get into the control center, and I get him transferred. And all of that was really, really good and became very exciting. And everything went well. Just like what they were mentioning. And with every launch there is that anticipation. Because of what had happened before that we were vulnerable in some ways. But we had the best of the best working on everything. And the next thing would have been Apollo 13. And when you, you've all seen the movie, I'm sure. You've all been part of that whole experience. My husband was Lynn Dunseith. And he was director over computer systems at that time. And when all of that came about where they showed the going into the back room or side room. And saying this is what they have in the LEM. How are we going to get them home? And so that was exciting for my children to know that dad new how all of that happened. Now, we have five children. And they learned more about Lynn at his funeral than they ever knew when he was alive. Because engineers, they didn't talk about their job. They were top secret situations. And so they knew he worked at NASA. They knew they could come on a tour. But that was exciting for all of us. And I was so glad to get to experience all of that. And then ending with, I stayed on after Apollo. But the, ending with Gene Cernan's flight was a big one for me. He was such a personal, all the astronauts were personal and kind to us. But, you know, sometimes you just kind of get with somebody that you can really sit and talk. Have coffee or do whatever. And not feel that you, you're not, that you should be staunch so.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Can you say a little more, Mary, about what it was like to be a woman in the mission control oort cloud at the time running around.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Well, being a woman in mission control for me was pretty exciting. I'm a woman who likes doors opened. I like being treated respectfully. And I like, I appreciated my, whatever you would call it, if you would call it my place. I was a secretary. Very proud secretary. I wouldn't mind if I served you coffee or a Estella coffee or anybody else in this room coffee. But we had a job to do, and we knew what we needed to do. And it was exciting. And I probably could have gone further in my career. All of my friends did. Estella was a secretary with me. Several of these ladies on this front row were secretaries with me. But I chose to go home and raise children. And so all of it's been great. And God put us where we needed to be, and he's been blessing us ever since.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you for that. Speaking of Estella, I'd like to know how you feel the work of equal opportunity has changed? And I'd love to hear about how it changed throughout your career as the director of the office when you were here.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: You know, equal opportunity came about legally through affirmative action laws and all of that. But here at Johnson, we could see the movement already beginning. Now, most of us who were female were secretaries. I can count on one hand how many technical women there were. And recently Teresa Sullivan and I had an experience where \"LA Times\" was looking to interview technical women of Apollo era. And I think we found one, okay. There were others, but that we had tracked, we found one. On the other hand, we had the 60s chicks. And I'd like to ask them to stand please. Those of you who were part of our 60s chicks.  [ Applause ]  These were, we were all women who were supporting the program. And like Mary said, we were doing whatever it took to do. Nobody asked questions. We just did it. And I tell you what, we were very good at what we did. So, you know, whatever you do, just be good at it. But as far as equal opportunity, you know, through my 40 years at the Johnson Space Center, I saw the movement get wider and wider and wider. And it came about mostly because now we had women for the technical side of JSC here. We had women who were going to college to get degrees, STEM-related degrees, okay. Early on there were not that many women going into STEM degrees. And I know that NASA and lots of other industry were very much involved with making sure that we had that reach out to the community. To make sure that women were getting interested and going into STEM-related fields. Once that happened, and I was on the astronaut selection board in 1979, '80. I can remember still we had just trickles of women who were qualified to become astronauts even then, okay. However, through the years, and I'll make this an example with Eileen Collins. We were looking for, in the astronaut selection, we were looking for women pilots, okay. If anybody knows about the qualifications for pilot, you kind of have to go, you can't rent a jet and go get that kind of practice, okay. So you kind of had to be in the test pilot school in the military, all right. So women were not allowed, until I think 1972, into test pilot school, okay. Eileen Collins was one of those who was allowed. And eventually a few years later she became our first female pilot astronaut, okay. That's kind of how it was happening. At the Johnson Space Center, I could see that very, very well moving on. And that's because I came here in 1964, when you can count the women in one hand who were technical. You could count the minorities on one hand who were at Johnson. And little by little we began to reach out to the community. I think 35 of my 40 years were part of, were involved in outreach. So now that I teach at the University of Houston and I look at my classrooms, I see that it worked. The outreach of other, not just NASA, but other communities going out there and making sure that we start at the bottom and start little kids getting interested. And not wait to the last minute and then wonder where we're going to get qualified people. So I think the country has done a great job as far as making sure that we get people involved at the bottom in education. And then in the job market, you get, you know, when I was director of equal opportunity, we used something called the relevant civilian labor force to measure who, how many we should have in each category. And that worked because you kind of go to the population that can do the job here. And that's where we draw from. You can't draw from the general population because they don't have the qualifications to do the kind of work that we do here. It's a very, and I'm sure you've experienced this. But it seemed to be a more quantitative way of going out and looking for folks. Making sure that, number one, we were involved with the development of the people that we wanted to recruit here. And, number two, once they get here, make sure that we develop people constantly over and over, giving them practice. And that's why I teach human resource development now. Because I think that is the way to do people, to get people qualified better. And to really be a part of the organization.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Yeah, I think that's wonderful. Especially since onboarding is a really significant part of all of our employer resource group's charters. Not only to bring folks on, but also to onboard them into what it's like to be working here at the space center. And how we can help support them going forward. So following on what you said, Ashley, I'd love to hear also from you in your role with the equal opportunity diversity. Talk to us a little bit about how your role has really shaped what's been going on here in the last few years. We now have inclusive innovation as part of our, you know, core tenets. And we've been doing so much work in that area. I'd love to know how you think going forward our workforce might need to adapt to what our challenges are coming at us with our new programs and everything else.  Ashley White: So this is an honor to share the stage. We see her picture in our office as a, literally every day. So when I walked in, I said, oh, hi. Because we are standing on the shoulders of such great work. So we are so appreciative. And this is the work that we are charged to continue to do. We look at the people, the policies and the procedure that are in place to make sure that it's a workplace free of discrimination. Retaliation. And harassment. So one of those aspects that we're doing to help is training. In fact, before I came here I was in the Gilruth talking to about 50 or 60 of our education interns. Making sure that they know what their rights and responsibilities are. Every year we do training through human resource management to managers so that everybody understands what their roles and responsibilities are. We take very seriously conflict resolution and mediation. Because unsolved conflict brews under the surface. And it becomes much more about than just that one thing. And it impacts and can really mess up an organization if it's not handled at the lowest level. You already spoke about the great work that the ERGs are doing. Our role in our office is to give them the maximum support possible to help them dream bigger dreams. You want to go where? Okay, well, let's figure out how we can do that. You want to do a panel? Okay, well, let's see how, what resources that we have within our office to do so. But we focus on reasonable accommodations. That is huge to make sure every single employee here understands their worth. And that they are valued. They are opinions matter. And if they need some additional assistance, our office is here in coordination with the center to make sure they have the resources they need.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: So talk to us a little bit about the next few years. We're going to have potentially a large ramp up in work. And deadlines. And what are some of the things that we need to be thinking about to support our workforce if we hire on, you know, a great deal more folks? Do we do temporary? Or however that looks. We're going to need all hands on deck to get this done. Are there things that you think we need to be putting in place now to really support that? Or what are some things that you think ahead we should consider?  Ashley White: We must always remember our JSC expected behaviors. Because regardless of what the work is or the pace of the work. If we don't respect one another. If we don't have tenets of teamwork and loyalty and integrity. We won't reach that next level. I think it's very important that we are respective and respectful of age. We had an employee last week retire with 54 years of experience. But we also have employees here with less than six months. So making sure that it's an equal playing field. That people feel like their opinions are valued. That they're heard. And especially in a safety culture, if you're like, well, no, I just got here. I can't say anything. That doesn't help us continue to improve. So I think, as we look ahead, making sure that we really use diversity and inclusion. Not just as tag words, but really tenets of who we stand for as JSC.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you so much for that. I agree wholeheartedly. And thinking on words to the future, I want to, Sarah, talk to you a little bit about your work. So you were part of the team that launched the first DNA sequencer to the ISS. Which is incredibly exciting. Congratulations. And that, also along with some of your other studies, have lead to the identification of some microbiomes that have been cultured off Earth. Which is also very exciting. So can you share with us the significance of your work. And also I'd love for you to tell us where you think the future of this work is headed. Especially as we try to get more Earth independent.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Yeah, so I think that we, in the life sciences, we look at ISS as this incredible platform for research. And an opportunity for us to learn. And for so long we've kind of operated in this world of, you know, we grow, we expose whatever model organism or whatever it is to the conditions of space flight. And then we bring the samples back to Earth for analysis. So what the team I'm on and the work we're doing is really to try to take really our labs and put them on ISS to give us the capability to do that analysis on board. And for me specifically as a micro biologist, we launched the DNA sequencer just to show that it would work. But then we really tried take it to the next level with, some of our routine work that we do is checking up on what the environment looks like microbially. And so actually having astronaut Peggy Whitson take some of these things that we routinely culture. Open them and identify them all on board the ISS. Which is a first. And we've never been able to do that. So we're really excited just to show that capability that we have, you know, we can do this stuff on Earth. We don't need to always fix or freeze a sample and bring it back. We can do it all in space. And I really think that this is going to be critical as we go forward. So as we look beyond ISS and we look towards exploration class missions, we need technologies that can give us real-time input on the environment that the crew's exposed to. Crew health themselves. Every aspect of that. And so I really think that these technologies will be absolutely critical. And that's the work we're continuing to try to do is to take it even one step further. Make it even more simple. Go beyond microbes. We've started doing some human work. And looking at the way, you know, developing methods that we can use to maybe understand how astronauts are responding to different things. And so I think there's a lot of potential. And I'm just, I'm really excited because I see the work that my colleagues are doing in similar areas. And I just think, in terms of the science, we're getting back. And in terms of getting us ready to go beyond ISS, we're really getting there. So which is a really exciting time. And I think it's, we're all eager. And we're all excited to, those of us that weren't around during Apollo. We're all just so excited to be able to be a part of that as we go forward with Artemis. And, you know, we're excited for our technologies and our methods to make an impact there. And I really think they will. And I think that we have a lot of good work still to do. But we've done a lot to really show that we have these capabilities now.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: So interestingly, in our world we talk a lot about astronaut health, as you said. And we have, you know, quarantine has always been something that after the Apollo missions was, you know, taken very seriously. And I know some of the conferences in the human health and performance world, lately we've been talking a lot about planetary and protection. And can you speak a little bit about how important that is as we're learning more about areas in your field of study. What the responsibility is that we have as we go and explore. And kind of how we can really relate that back to plan those designs for that.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Yeah, so within that kind of, within the realm of planetary protection, there's always two things we're worried about. And I would say, when we went to the moon the first time, we weren't so, we weren't as worried about contaminating the moon. We were worried about back-contaminating Earth. Which was why the quarantine of the astronauts over in the old building 37 was so important. Because, if there was some andromeda strain, we wanted to make sure we weren't exposing, you know, population of Earth to this. So NASA took that very seriously. And so that's, you know, there's great stories. If you're interested, find me later. I know them all. So it was a really exciting time. But now, as we look, we're still always going to be worried about that, as we haven't explored Mars and some of these other bodies. Enceladus. Europa. That, you know, many scientists are excited might harbor life. So really there's those two aspects of, one, not bringing anything back. And, two, how much we're contaminating it. We are walking microbiomes. We have all these bacteria that are associated with us. That, you know, we don't want to, if there is life there, we don't want to impact that life on that planet or moon. So really having the capability to get a good baseline to understand what we have in us and on us. What's in and on our spacecraft vehicles. On the space suits. Every little aspect of this is really important to establish that baseline so we can understand what we are, you know, contributing potentially to another surface. And so that, you know, then, if we do find something, is that novel or is that something we put there? So, and, again, always monitoring what we're bringing back with us. So those are the two big areas we're concerned with. And we're, with the technology we have now with the DNA sequencer and the methods we've developed, we're really excited. We're working with all of our international partners to really kind of form one method that we can all use to really start piecing all this together. So all of that's in work. And I think the next few years are going to be really exciting as we have the technologies to both screen for life beyond Earth. And measure what we're taking with us beyond Earth.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. I appreciate that perspective of sort of the big picture of some reasons of why we go. And what we're thinking of, you know, when we pick our head up and go where are we aiming for? What are we trying to accomplish? And to that end also, Dianne and I were talking earlier. I'd love to hear, Dianne, your thoughts. You alluded to sort of the, we talked a little bit about the pace of the work that was happening around the Apollo time. And we're being tasked for the next four years to do something very similar. And, you know, the methods you mentioned were different than they are now. Can you talk about how you think we might be able to face that challenge of this quick turnaround. But you also have some great perspective on what the pace in life was like here beforehand.  Dianne Milner: Well, actually it was a very heated rush, pressure to get to the moon for Apollo 11. And the technologies that we had to work with back then were really primitive compared to what we have now. So I think personally going to the moon in 2024 is going to be a piece of cake. But realistically I think we have the technology. The brilliance in our community and workforce here to make sure it's done right. And it's going to be right before we go. We have certainly a deadline, but I don't feel the pressure, unless it's right, that we'll go before then. But I think we'll get there definitely. Maybe not exactly 2024, but close to it.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you for that. So I want to pause for a second and just remind that you in about five minutes we're going to go to our Slido questions. So if haven't already contributed and you would like to, please do that. And, Jessica, I'm just going to confirm with you, I'm going to do one more round. And then you're going to toss it over to Slido for the, up to the end; right? So, okay, great. So I kind of wanted to go down the road this time, since we've got about five minutes before we throw it out to the audience. I would love to hear from each of you what nugget do you want to leave this audience with, this group? This group that's really intent on learning from how we've done things and where we need to be going forward. What is any nugget that you would like to share with this group? Love to hear it? Mary, do you want to start us off?  Mary Dunseith Henry: Well, I guess what I'd like to say is for those of you who are still working here and those of you who are retired from here. It's the greatest opportunity that we had or will have. We all touch somebody. And whether it's mentoring a young person that's on their way up. Just knowing that this is it. This is the greatest place to start your career and end your career here, if that need be. But the people that you meet, the mentors that you have. And I don't believe there's one NASA employee or past employee that you couldn't reach out to if you had a question. We are all available. And we all want to go in the same direction. So that's the nugget I would leave.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. Ashley.  Ashley White: So the best piece of advice I got, I actually got recently. Couple years ago I was struggling with trying to balance work and caring for an ailing grandmother. And my manager said to me, be your best wherever you are. So if you're at work, fully commitment to being at work. If you're in the hospital, fully commitment to caring for her. And that's freed me from trying to be everything to every person at all times. And I wasn't giving anybody my best. So if I could give you what was given to me, be your best wherever you are. And if that means, excuse me, having to have a pep rally of one before a meeting. If that means sitting in your car and getting your mind right before you walk into work. Do whatever it is that you need to do to make sure you're your best wherever you are.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: Dang, that's a tough one. Because I have so much advice I could give you guys. So much. Yeah, lots. But I think, you know, and I go back to 1964. When I came in 1964, it was October 19th, 1964. Memorable day for me. The Johnson Space Center the Manned Spacecraft Center had just opened the gates. So there were a few buildings. It was me coming here and saying, oh, my God, what have I done? Because, when I applied for the government service and I passed, this was just a few months after I became a naturalized citizen. Because I was born in Mexico. And I passed a civil service exam. And I came here. I had three interviews. And I went home and told my mom and my dad that I had a job offer. In fact, I had three job offers. And my mom and dad said, you're not going there. I said, why not? It's too far to drive. You're not going there. Because we lived on the other side of the Pierce Elevated now. And my, and I said, yes, I am. And, you know, Mexican culture, very, very strict. And that was a very rebellious thing for me to do is to say, yes, I am. And my mom says, you don't have a car. I said, I'll buy one. So I bought a car. I was here. Three months later my dad talked about me as if I owned the Johnson – or the Manned Spacecraft Center. He was so proud. He was so proud. But coming here was so scary. Because there weren't a lot of people that looked like me. And I wasn't even really conscious of that. It was just that it was mostly white men. And they were mostly wearing white shirts with black ties and pocket protectors. They really did wear those, okay. And, but what I found was that, because I was good at what I was supposed to be doing, they all thought I was great. And because I started as a secretary and I got my training in high school, Jeff Davis High School here in town. They thought, the guys that I worked with, there were 21 of them. And it was Building 13, Structures and Mechanics Division in Building, yeah, 13. They thought I was fascinating because I could type 98 words a minute, okay. I could take shorthand at 80 words a minute, you know. And I think a lot of us could do that in that time, okay. So I think the best advice I can give you is do the job you're supposed to be doing and do the best at it. And in the meantime pick up some additional skills for the next job that you're going to. But I met a few people along the way who aspired for other things, but they weren't really doing what they were supposed to be doing already. So my advice is look at your job description. What are you supposed to be doing? I mentioned the mentoring already. You mentioned respect and dignity. Those go a long way. So I think this is a wonderful home. Like Mary says, and I think all of us would agree here, it's a wonderful place to work. If somebody had told me in 1963, when I graduated from high school, that I was going to make a career out of here. I would have said, NASA, what's that? Because I did not know what NASA was until my yearbook featured the original seven astronauts. And then I knew what NASA was. And I made it home here. It's like a family. Mary mentioned the family a few times. It is a family. Find out who the members are. Find out what works and what doesn't work. Look at the people around you. What do they do? Who do you want to become like? You have so many goods examples. There's historical examples. There's current examples. And I marvel at this young lady [indicates Sarah Wallace] and what she's doing. I wish I had done that. So I really could go on and on about all the wonderful things here. But just enjoy what you do. And consider yourself privileged because you really are.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Well, that's hard to follow. But I just want to build on what Estella said. It's the, if you have passion, and anyone who knows me knows I, absolutely incredibly passionate about what I do. But it's, don't take no for an answer. It's, I have been told no so many times about an idea. Or, you know, something simple to something big. But I don't let that stop me. And you just, if you have an idea that you really believe in. And you're really passionate about. And you really see the benefit. Just keep pushing. And, you know, there's been times I've been concerned is it my age? Is it the way I look? What is it that I'm, you know, being told no about? And you don't stop to where then, you know, you, I feel like our work now is having a huge impact. And what we're doing is really causing change. And that's so great. Because I look back to a couple years ago, and it was just like dead end after dead end. So just don't stop. If you're passionate, just keep going. And somebody will finally, you know, you'll get somebody to kind of buy into what you're saying. And hopefully, you know, we can all continue to move mountains and get us closer to our next goal.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Love that. Thank you. Dianne, you want to bring us home?  Dianne Milner: Yes. I was just thinking out at Rice Stadium there's a big billboard that says, be the best that you can be. And I think that more or less sums it up. If you're bored, if you're not interested, change jobs. Find something else. But be happy with what you're doing. Be involved with others that you're working with. And you have a challenge out there to satisfy yourself and be successful. Follow that dream, that hope, and you will be.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. That's a beautiful way to end. Thank you so much for all of your participation. I think we're going to throw it back over to our moderators to do the questions. So let me just give you all a round of applause from myself personally. Thank you for answering my questions and for talking to us today. Thank you so much.  [ Applause ]  Question: So this first question is for Sarah and Ashley. What does equality at JSC and NASA mean to you? Have we achieved it? Or what more should we strive for?  Ashley White: You said equality?  Question: Yes, equality.  Ashley White: What does it mean to me? And has it been achieved at NASA? It is an everlasting goal. Because just when you think you have reached it, the marks change. We are, diversity is not a one-time fix. The same thing with equality. But it's making sure that we have a fair and balanced workforce. And that every opportunity is equal to everyone. So for me I think JSC is striving. We are striving to be what we call on our side of the house an EEO model center. And that is where we put practices and plans in place to ensure that we're continuing to improve. Because, as we have all these new challenges, the same thing arises on the mission support side to make sure that we don't stay stagnant. What worked 50 years ago has changed. And being open to embracing the newness of people. The newness of ideas. The diversity of thought.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: And I agree completely. And I would say there's always that, when, you know, when I was talking about, you know, being told no or something. There's always that little ugliness in the back of your mind. It's like is it because, what is it? Is it because I'm female? Is it because I'm young? I dye my hair blond, what is it? And so it's, there's always that, but I think we are moving past that. And equality for me is, you know, anyone of us can be taken as seriously as, you know, a senior or male who's been here for a much longer time. And I think we are getting there. But as you're saying, it's always, you know, I feel like we always need to be striving to make sure we're keeping to progress in that way. And listen to everybody's ideas and everybody's thoughts regardless, you know, of their background. And, you know, I think that JSC is doing a phenomenal job of this. And we are keeping it very at the front of our mind. And I think we'll continue to do so.  Question: Next question for our Apollo guests. What traits do you see that are common to all women who have been successful here at JSC?  Dianne Milner: I think loyalty and ambition. You know, I've seen those two outstanding traits. Willingness to work. To get their goals, what they want to do.  Mary Dunseith Henry: I'll just mirror what she said as well. But I think Estella could probably answer this question very well.  [ Laughter ]  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: Mary used to do that to me all the time when we worked together. She's still doing it. What traits? I looked at women like Marilyn Bocktine. Some of you remember Marilyn. Virginia Hughes, okay. She was federal women's program manager. Carolyn Huntoon. Who was kind of like way up there because she was a scientist. And, you know, she one of the guys too. I think what I wanted to become was one of the guys, but still be a female. You know, what I'm saying? I mean, I liked the world that the men seemed to have built. And, you know, I kind of eased my way into it by doing what I said earlier. Mimicking some of the women that were my role models like Marilyn Bocktine. One of the things that I realized early on is, if I looked for a role model that looked like me, I couldn't find one back then, okay. So I looked for a role model that was in the same discipline as I was. And Marilyn was secretary to George Low, okay. Kind of Apollo father kind of guy. But she was so fun. Virginia Hughes was so fun. So look for those traits that you think are important to you and that you can imitate or become like. But also look for the traits that the guys have, okay. I had bosses like George Abbey. One day I want to become just like him when I grow up, okay. I had bosses like Cliff Charlesworth, Apollo 11 and Apollo 13. Who everybody said was not very friendly. But he was soft as a pussycat. He was just such a nice guy when I finally found out who he was. I had bosses like John Young. Who was exciting to be around just because of what he had done. But I picked up traits from all of them, not just women, okay. Because I think it's important to blend the characteristics of those people who make this place what it is. So if you kind of look too much for something that you're really comfortable with, then you'll never change and get there. So look for things that you're not comfortable with, I think.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. Okay.  Question: So our last question for today. Did any of you have a male mentor or supporter who encouraged you in your careers? If so, can you talk about your advice or their advice?  Mary Dunseith Henry: Can you repeat that question.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Did any of you have you a male mentor in your career that supported you? And can you tell us a little bit about their advice to you? Is that, did I catch that right? Okay.  Mary Dunseith Henry: So a male mentor for me would have been John Zarcaro. And he was very good at what he did. And he was a very kind man. And he always supported you when you got something bad. In those days our letters didn't just go out, we typed them. And we had to make carbon copies. We didn't have corrective tape or anything like that. So we had a woman, Estella, what was her name? You know who I'm talking about. [Laughter] Y’all know who I'm talking about. What was her name?  Audience: Lee Brubaker.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: Brubaker.  Mary Dunseith Henry: No.  Audience: Iris Garner.  Audience: Betsy.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Okay. I guess I don't know. My letters from the ninth floor went through Lee Brubaker. That's who my letters went through. And she was a really sweet person. Kind of like what Estella said about Cliff Charlesworth. When we came to work, she went to work for Charlesworth. And I went to work for Zarcaro. I was afraid of Charlesworth until you got to know him. But she had the reputation of carrying a big stick. And you didn't want your letter that needed to be out by five o'clock and she wasn't going to get it till 3:00 along with the other 300 letters that she was getting from all of the other secretarial staff. So that's kind of where I'm coming from.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Male mentor, does anybody want to share?  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Yeah. So the NASA microbiologist before me, Duane Pierson and Mark Ott, who I look up to both tremendously. But Mark was, has actually been a mentor for me since I was in graduate school. And he always, you know, coming back to what you're passionate about and your work ethic. He always told me, you know, cream rises to the top. So if you work hard, while there are days here that it seems like nothing is working. And there's politics and there's other things involved. At the end, if you continue to work hard and do good work, it will be seen. And you will be recognized for it. And so that has absolutely held true for me. So the times where, you know, he's been very good about when things have been rough, you know, in the end, if you work hard, things will come through.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Actually, am I allowed to break protocol and answer this question?  Question: Yeah.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Yeah, okay. So I had two fantastic male mentors. The first one was Walt Guy. Who some of you know and have worked with. He was the head of the engineering robotics department when I was first there. And he was sort of a silent supporter. I never knew he was championing me from behind the scenes, but he was the entire time. And the advice I got with working for Walt, if you know Walt and you've done disk assessments, he's very green. He likes the data. And he liked to know all the information before making a decision. And so the advice I got was, you're going to go up in front of Walt, make sure you know. And if he asks you a question you don't know the answer, tell them you don't know the answer. And if you do know the answer and you want to, you know, go back and forth, go back and forth. Because you know, and you've got the data to back it up. And that was the best advice I ever got working with him. And as a result, we formed this very trusting bond. He knew he could come to me, and I would tell it like it was. Or I'd say, I have no idea. But that's a darn good question. I'm going to go find out. So that was a piece of advice that I really took to heart. Especially working with people who just like the facts. The other mentor that had was Steve Altemus. Who was the head of Engineering Directorate. And I was up as an executive intern for a few months. And I had been here about seven or eight years. And he says to me one day, Jen, what do you want to do? What do you want to do here? I was like, nobody's ever asked me that before. I think when I got here I thought, okay, I'm ready for my next assignment. I'm ready for my next assignment. I'm ready for my next assignment. And he was the first person who said, what do you want to do? And I told him. I said, I think it's really important that we get humans integrated into the spacecraft from the beginning. And he said, I think that's great. So he asked me to go work constellation from the engineering perspective with the human systems group and partner with the human health and performance, that then was space lab sciences. And we made a great team and did that work going forward. And he, and, you know, I heard this phrase from him. You know, no one's going to care about your career more than you do. And so it's great to have mentors and leads and advices, but you've got to take that initiative. And he switched the bit in my mind that I was responsible for making things happen. And so I really appreciate that. And I guess the only other nugget I would leave all of our panelists with is I very much value showing up with authenticity. I think we bring our whole selves to work. It sounds trite sometimes, but it's really true when you work from a place, an authentic place. And I think all of you have touched on that in your stories. I've heard that. That nugget is, when you come through and you are your authentic self. And you're showing up that way, that's what creates that community and that bond and that opportunity for everyone. So thanks for letting me break protocol and answer. Because I've only got a week or two, so I got to get it out now. Thank you all so much for your participation. And I think we're going to hand it back to Vanessa and Jessica for wrapping up.  Vanessa Wyche: Awesome. What a wonderful, wonderful panel. Thank you.  [ Applause ]  [ Music ]  Host: All right then. That's a really interesting discussion, Jessica. Kudos to WELL for getting these women to share their thoughts on the panel. And letting us share it with this wider audience.  Jessica Vos: Oh, gosh, thank you so much for the opportunity.

Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode 61, Hostile and Closed Environments.  This is part five of our five-part series on the five hazards of human space flight.  How many times can I say five in a row?  Five times.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers and astronauts, all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So, today, like I said, is the final chapter in this five-part series.  The Human Journey to Mars is an extremely complex undertaking and challenging hazards such as radiation, isolation confinement, distance from Earth, gravity, and this last one, hostile enclosed environments are being studied using ground-based analogs, laboratories, and of course the International Space Station, right above us.  Today we consider closed and hostile environments with Dr. Brian Crucian, a biological studies and immunology expert at the Johnson Space Center.  Brian serves as the principal investigator for a NASA functional immune study.  According to him, \"the immune system is very complex, and several aspects of immunity remain uninvestigated during space flight.   We now need to delve deeper into the immune system changes that happen in space and determine if these changes during flight elevate clinical risks for astronauts in future deep space missions.\"  We'll also hear clips from my conversation with Dr. Stan Love, NASA astronaut and just a super smart guy.  Love shared his own perspective about living in a hostile and closed environment himself, and some thoughts about what it will take to make a successful deep space mission.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Brian Crucian.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]   Host:  Brian, thank you for coming on the podcast today.   Dr. Brian Crucian:  It's a pleasure.   Host: So, this is last in our series of five hazards.  We've talked to a lot of experts on the different hazards of space flights, particularly dealing with the human body, but this last one I think might be one of the more interesting, at least to me, is hostile and closed environments, because how I think of it is, you know, you kind of have to almost invent your own planet or earth, something that's going to contain the human body in a livable space in the not so livable, you know, interplanetary space, and then carry it from one body to another.  It's such an interesting concept.  But you're an expert in immunology, so I think we should kind of start there, is when we're talking about a hostile or closed environment, where does immunology come in?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Humans need a well-functioning immune system to maintain our health, and that means protecting us from pathogens, viruses, bacteria.  On the way home, someone may sneeze on you, and you might catch a rhinovirus or an adenovirus, and you'll have a cold, and you'll be sick for seven days.  And so you need a well-functioning immune system, all these different cells that are in the blood and the lymph nodes to keep you healthy.  But you also need a well-maintained, a well-tuned immune system, and so the immune system can go out whack.  And if it is hyperactive, you might be at risk for things like allergy, asthma.  If it really persists as a problem, you might develop autoimmune diseases.  You also need a healthy immune system to keep you from getting other diseases such as cancer.  One of the functions of the immune system is to keep you from getting cancer.  We have cells in our body called natural killer cells, and they scavenge the body for malignant cells and eliminate them.  And so you need a very well-maintained and properly operating immune system, and when you go into an adverse environment, such as space flight, or there are terrestrial adverse environments, the immune system can become dysregulated, and we say dysregulated, not suppressed, because it can be functioning too little or functioning too much, a little hyperactive, and so we, at NASA we have a variety of assays that we can monitor the immune system of the astronauts and see how well their immune system is functioning during space flight.   Host: So what do we know right now?  Let's just, let's go to the International Space Station.  What's happening to the immune system up there right now.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, if you don't mind, I'll back up a little bit before that.   Host: Oh, please.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And so, as immunologists, our community, and this is immunologists in Europe, Canada, Japan, Russia.  Our community has been very interested in what happens to people during space flight because we all want to get ready for those exploration missions, those deep space missions.  And so when we head the space shuttle, all right, you could get a sample, a blood sample or a saliva sample from someone, look at their immune system after space flight.  And if you get a sample from someone after space flight, what you're really looking at are the stresses of landing.  Landing is scary.  Re-adaptation after a prolonged deconditioning is a stressor, and so you're really looking at those stressors.  And so we needed the International Space Station to come along to give us two things.  We need long duration space flight, all right, because if you look at people during short duration space flight, you're looking at the sprint.  We want to look at the marathon because that's more like a Mars mission or a prolonged lunar mission, right.  And we also need the ability to sample them and return those samples during that long duration space flight.  And so we needed the advent of this national laboratory to afford us the ability to look at what happens to people during long duration orbital flight.   And in this situation, we're using orbital space flight as an analog or model for those exploration missions.  We have other analogs or models we use on Earth as representative space flight, for example, Antarctic winter over or undersea missions.   Host: Okay.  All right.  Do they all give us different and relevant data points that help us understand deep space flight, then?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Yes, we are learning through a variety of flight studies that have been happening on board the International Space Station.  We're learning what happens to the immune system during long duration space flight, all right, and there is an early adaptation phase, which is say the first 45 days where you're adjusting to the environment and getting used to those new stressors, this hostile environment, and then you settle out into what we call space normal.  And so we're really more interested in sampling people on say the back half of their six-month mission so we can see what their immune system and other physiological systems also, what they have settled out to be for space normal.  We think that's more reflective of what might be happening during say a mission that would take several years to Mars.  This will allow us to think about countermeasures for this phenomenon.  Design those countermeasures while we have ISS, maybe validate those countermeasures so we can keep astronauts safe during those deep space exploration missions.   Host: So what do we know about the state of the astronauts at the end of their six-month increments.  What state is the immune system in?   Dr. Brian Crucian: So the immune system is very complicated.  It's one of the most complicated systems in the body.  You have many different types of cells.  Lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, and they all have distinct function.  Some of these are comprised of what we call innate immunity that functions immediately.  If you say puncture your skin, those cells go to work immediately, and they're nonspecific.  They want to eat those bacteria and heal that wound and protect you.  You also have other types of cells that are what we call pathogen specific.  If you get that virus on the way home, you get that adenovirus or that rhinovirus, you need virus-specific immunity.  And so that takes about a week to generate and eliminate that pathogen, but that stays with you for the rest of your life, and you have memory to that particular virus.  You never get the same cold virus twice.  And so when we look at astronauts during space flight, we have to look at all these different aspects of their immune system to answer that simple question.  What's happening to innate immunity.  What's happening to adaptive immunity.  The B cells make antibodies.   The T cells control viruses.  The natural killer cells help keep us from getting cancer, and so it's a complicated question, and we're still looking at some of these aspects.  What we have looked at very well have been molecules called cytokines in the blood plasma of astronauts, the molecules that regulate immunity, and we can look at them over the course of a mission and see what type of dysregulation, what type of inflammation we have.  We've looked at certain types of cells, cells that control latent herpes virus reactivation, and we see those don't work as well.  That leads to the reactivation of certain types of viruses in astronauts.  And so we're characterizing this phenomenon in astronauts.  They're not sick at all.  I mean they're working hard and enjoying their missions, but these are subclinical phenomenon that make us a little bit worried about what might happen on a Mars mission that would take several years where you're going to increase the radiation, and you have no rapid return option.   [sound effect]  Host: So next I ask about things growing on the space station, but before we get into that, Stan Love gave his own insight into things growing in the space environment and how that relates to planetary protection.   [sound effect]  Stan Love:  So the microbes that are in your environment are the ones that you bring with you largely.  Microbes have a very fast turnover rate, so they could evolve a little bit, change a little bit while you're in space, but not a lot.  I think they have isolated new microbes on the space station.  The space station has been up there for ten years, so it's had time.  But planetary protection is actually something we need to pay pretty close attention to.  The moon is probably as dead as a doornail.  It has had no atmosphere for four and a half billion years.  It gets irradiated by the sun, the ultraviolet light, the solar wind, the cosmic rays.  There's no water.  The temperatures in the daytime are over-boiling.  The temperatures are night are 200 degrees below zero, and we're pretty sure, and we've got the samples back from [inaudible], of course, and we've looked through them, and we have found nothing alive.  We did find some spores on a TV camera, on a probe we sent to the moon, and then later the astronauts landed next to that probe and brought home the TV camera lens to study how it had changed in ten years, and they found some viable microbe spores that had not yet been killed, but those guys were not growing and multiplying.   Yeah, microbes are tough.   Host:  Wow.   Stan Love:   So with that in mind, microbes are very tough, when we talk about Mars, now that's got an atmosphere.  The daytime highs are not as hot.  The nights are cold, but the nights are cold in Antarctica, and there are algae living inside rocks in Antarctica that can only photosynthesize during the summer when the sun comes out.  So life is pretty tough, and there might be microbes on Mars that when they got into a nice, warm, moist, happy Earth environment would go berserk and destroy our lives here.   Host: That would stink.   Stan Love:   Okay, the odds are low, but the risk is terrible.  Have you ever seen the movie, The Andromeda Strain, it gives you a hint of what could possibly happen.  That one came back from Venus, and I'm not worried about Venus.  Venus is probably really sterile.   Host: It's pretty hot there.   Stan Love:   It's really dang hot, yeah.   [sound effect]  Host: Yeah.  Would then, it would be something that would develop internally or would it be something maybe from the environment.  Because just from having conversations with some of the experts in the past, it seems like there's, you know, fungus and just stuff growing in the space station.  Is that something that's a concern from an immunology perspective?   Dr. Brian Crucian: So that's a great question, and what you're basically asking is what causes it.   Host: Yeah, yeah.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And so that's a complicated answer as well.   Host: Hum.   Dr. Brian Crucian: You have humans in space is what we called an applied experiment, meaning if I'm doing an experiment in my laboratory, I'm controlling one variable.  I want to see if a certain diet or radiation or microgravity causes an effect.  When I put humans in space, they're subjected to a whole bunch of variables, and I can't stop that from happening.  So they're experiencing stress, microgravity, radiation, alter circadian rhythms.  They see a sun rise and a sun set every 90 minutes.  Isolation and a confinement.  And so what we're really talking about is not the effect of microgravity but the effect of space flight on these people.  And space flight is defined as all these variables.  So all of these variables create a synergy, and they affect the human body adversely, and we see effects on bone, muscle, fluid shifts, the immune system, and so collectively, we at JSC and around the world, these scientists are trying to characterize these phenomenon so we can develop counter measures.   Host: Hum.  So what do we know about counter measures that we, do we have counter measures right now?  What are we doing to, based on what we know and recognize, are there things that we have in place that can sort of help protect the immune system on board.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, that's another big question.  We can probably spend an hour talking about counter measures--   Host: Hey, we have an hour.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And I'll try and keep it to the 50,000 foot level.  And so, yes, we have counter measures that are already in place.  Things that you might not consider a counter measure are in fact a counter measure.  Radiation shielding is a counter measure.  Maintaining a clean spacecraft is a counter measure.  Propulsion is actually a type of counter measure.  If you can get me to Mars in two weeks, a lot of the problems I'm worried about go away.   Host: Oh, yeah.   Dr. Brian Crucian: But what people classically think about is say the pill that you would take as your counter measure.   Host: Right.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And so we, for the immune system, we would look at things like nutrition supplements, probiotics, things that you can take to reduce inflammation and actually medications, pharmacological interventions can influence the immune system.  And so where we stand in my discipline is we're trying to characterize this phenomenon, and we'll defer our selection of countermeasures until we've completed characterization, and there are several European, Russian, and American studies that are working to characterize this phenomenon.  Then we'll sit down with researchers, flight surgeons, practicing clinical immunologists and collectively look at this data and then try and figure out, okay, what will the counter measure be for the immune system.  Other disciplines I'm sure have the same discussion with their experts.  When you've selected your counter measure, then you would probably want to look at that in the ground environment first and validate it, and if there's time, within the life span of ISS, you would want to do an in-flight validation also.   Host: So we have a lot of data on the International Space Station already.  You know, we've been up there for nearly 18 years at this point for continuous human presence, just a lot of people going up and living there, successfully too.  We do things, like you're saying, with counter measures, just wiping down the inside of the space station.  So what do we understand about living in a closed environment so far?  Do we even have to worry about some sort of external, I mean I'm thinking, when I think of immunology, the first thing I think about, like you're saying, is like a common cold.  There's just some sort of virus bacteria, something that can affect, you know, I guess us in every day life, but an astronaut, you know, do we even have to worry about that in a closed environment?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, the answer is yes, and we learned that early on in the space program.  If you've ever seen the great movie Apollo 13, you know about how a space mission can be affected by clinical disease, either before the mission or during the mission, and in fact, we had several infectious disease events during the Apollo program, and that led to the implementation of the health stabilization program, which is basically your preflight quarantine.  After that was implemented, the rates for infectious disease during space missions went down.  And so that was one of the first operational countermeasures that was really put in place to help keep astronauts healthy during their space missions.  There are other types of operational countermeasures that we're doing today.  We screen, you seem to be asking about environmental concerns, and we screen food that goes up, payloads that go up.  Get a toxicological screen, a microbial screen, and so we're trying our best to keep this environment clean and that will help keep the astronauts safe.   Host: Yeah.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And as we continue to characterize things that happen to physiology during missions on ISS, you'll start to see more discussion of these biomedical counter measures, just something that someone might ingest to supplement or a medication.  But collectively, all of these operational counter measures and counter measures that are ingestible, will be employed on these deep space exploration missions.   Host: For sure.   Dr. Brian Crucian: The cleanest environment, the fastest space ship, the most pristine foods and water that we can get, and this wonderful set of medications to help keep people healthy.   Host: Man, that sounds like a great place to spend some time in space.  Yeah, that's a good vehicle, the one you're describing.   Dr. Brian Crucian: You can set it up.  I'm willing to go with you.  [laughter]   [sound effect]  Host: So that's a great overview of what we know so far about living on the ISS.  Stan Love added a few more details outside of immunology, and there's a lot here, about ten minutes worth of stuff, but stick with me, because it's super interesting and totally worth it.  And we'll get back into the immune system afterwards.   [sound effect]  Host:  Now how about the International Space Station specifically.  What are we learning, what are we learning on there about living in a closed environment, maybe about lights, maybe about air, maybe about stuff like that?   Stan Love:   Well first of all, with the confinement of small volume, space station crews to my knowledge have never complained that there wasn't enough room.  So the space station is good for at least six months, but the space station is really big, and we can't sent it to Mars because it's too big.   Host: Yeah.   Stan Love:   Lighting, lighting on the space station early on tended to be kind of dim, and there was enough light for people to do their work, but it affects your mood, your emotional state, if the lights are too dim all the time.  Getting exposure to sunlight is important for keeping your biological clock running properly, so you feel sleepy at bedtime, you sleep well at night, and then you wake up refreshed in the morning.  That's not a given in space.  We're going to Mars without planet to interpose itself between us and the sun to make night.  It's always going to be full sunlight outside, but there aren't going to be very many windows, so it's going to be artificial lighting inside.  Lighting on the space station has been gradually changing out with brighter lights and lights that you can change to be blueish in the morning, and that helps your biological clock to say, oh, it's morning.  It time to get up and be energetic, and they can actually make them a little bit redder in the evening on the space station.  And that tells your biological clock, oh, the sun is going down.  I should be getting ready to have a meal and go to sleep.   So we've got that capability on the space station now, and I haven't heard anybody complaining about the light.  So I think we've got that.  Food, water, and air are crucial.  We don't last long without those, and for Mars, we cannot take enough fresh water in tanks to keep the crew hydrated for six months, nine months out, a year on the surface of Mars, nine months back.  So we're going to have to recycle our water.  And yes, that's gross.  And my buddy Spanky, who's spent a couple of tours on the space station calls it turning yesterday's coffee into tomorrow's coffee.   Host: I love that.   Stan Love:   So that piece of equipment, first it has to work really well.  If your water starts tasting like pee, you're going to be an unhappy person.   Host: Oh yeah.   Stan Love:   And eventually an unhealthy person.  And if it breaks, you're stuffed, right.   Host: Oh, yeah.   Stan Love:   You are in terrible trouble, and unfortunately this kind of closed life support, you know, where we recycle most of our water, so we can distill clear water out of urine, the stuff left behind is so gross you don't even want to think about it.  It's like dark brown, ammonia, stinking sludge.   Host: Oh, now I'm thinking about it.   Stan Love:   Yeah, oh, so, okay.  So that part we can't recycle, although we're thinking about ways to get even, squeeze even more water out of that, but I hope that works really well because the sludge that it's coming from is not appetizing.  You have to do the same thing with your air.  You inhale, actually most of our air is nitrogen that our bodies don't use.  But you inhale, you burn up some of that oxygen, you exhale some carbon dioxide.  You've got to pull that carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  Over the years, that's given us a lot of trouble.  We had what we thought were machines that could keep the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere down to a nice low comfortable level, but we're finding out that with six months of exposure, a level of CO2 that you wouldn't even notice, CO2 carbon dioxide, that you wouldn't even notice if you were exposed to it for a day, if you were exposed to it days on end, it starts giving you headaches.  There are mood changes.  People get irritable.  It adjusts the chemistry of your blood if you're breathing a lot of carbon dioxide.  That's what actually triggers your breathing reflex, those changes in the acidity of your blood.   Host: Ooh.   Stan Love:   Good stuff.  And so we're finding that for a long duration, we need to keep the carbon dioxide down at a low, low level where our machines can barely keep the CO2 down there, because you're trying to scrub, you know, if scrubbing carbon dioxide out of air was easy, we wouldn't have any worries about climate change.  Getting carbon dioxide out of air is hard.  It takes a lot of power, complicated machinery, things that absorb carbon dioxide when they're cold, and then you seal those off, open a vent to the outside, heat it up, and drive the CO2 out overboard.  Where now we actually can take the carbon dioxide and water that people are exhaling, you also exhale water vapor that has to be captured from the cabin atmosphere and removed or the humidity gets really high and it gets real sticky and gross inside.  So all that stuff has to work, and we have to try to recycle some of it, and we can actually convert some of that captured oxygen and carbon dioxide back to water and oxygen that we can use.   Host: Nice.   Stan Love:   So that part is good, but then we're dumping methane overboard.  Well we could keep that methane and use it for rocket propellant, if we were very clever about it.  But there's going to be some loss, but we have to recycle and recycle and recycle because we just can't carry all that much raw materials.  And so that equipment becomes crucial.  If it breaks, you're going to die.  They gloss over this quickly in the Martian if you saw that movie or read the book.   Host: Yeah.   Stan Love:   The science is even better in the book.  The movie did a pretty good job.  The book does an excellent job.  He sort of glosses over, yeah, the air recycler has to keep working, and it never broke, so that was good, because he lived.   Host: Right.   Stan Love:   And when you think about space ships, you know, we have satellites that do communications, that take pictures of the Earth.  We have robots that go out to the planets, and we've launched thousands and thousands of these things over the history of space programs.  And all of them have a power system and a computer system and a communication system and structures and thermal control and all these other systems, only a couple have had life support systems.  So we have millions of hours of run time on basic spacecraft mechanical systems.  We don't have as many hours on life support systems.  So this technology is in its infancy compared to most of the things that are on space ships, and hence, they break a lot.  You know, on the space station that's fine.  We have a lot of spare parts on the space station and we can send up more with, you know, six weeks of notice, because we got robot ships going up there all the time.   Host: Yeah.   Stan Love:   On the way to Mars though, nah ah.  You don't have a possibility of resupply.  You can prestage some stuff at Mars, but as we like to darkly, humorously point out, if your life support system breaks halfway to Mars, you have the rest of your life to fix it.  [laughter]   Host: That is pretty dark but pretty funny.   Stan Love:   Yeah, so, but it gets the point across, right.   Host: It does, it does.   Stan Love:   You've got to get this repaired or you're going to die.   Host: Yeah.   Stan Love:   And it must recycle because we cannot bring raw materials.  The one things we can't recycle yet at all is food.  So turn poop into a salad, only the Earth can do that for you.   Host: Ah.   Stan Love:   Okay.  Only the Earth can turn your poop into salad.   Host: Right.   Stan Love:   And I mean an appetizing salad.  So we, a farm needs sunlight.  Sunlight is something like 1000 watts on every square root yard of plants.   Host: Wow.   Stan Love:   And when you figure out how much grow lights that is, no space craft power system can support that.  Even if you made a farm and grew a couple of very selective crops on small areas that was barely enough to feed the crew, plants get sick.  Single species plants get sick easy.  And if a, you know, rust wipes out your wheat crop halfway to Mars, you're out of luck, right.  You got no harvest, you're dead.   Host: Yeah.   Stan Love:   And, you know, this was a problem for humans in antiquity.  We've gotten better at that, you know, with fertilizers and, you know, pest treatments for our crops, but it's tough to re-create a farm in a space craft.  The power, the weight, you could use sunlight, but now you need giant windows, engineers hate little tiny windows because keeping the air pressure inside from blowing the window out to the outside means heavy structures and triple panes of glass, and that gets big and heavy and you can't make a greenhouse.  The same thing on Mars.  It doesn't have enough air pressure to hold your greenhouse down, the internal pressure from normal air is 15 pounds on every square inch of that glass on the greenhouse.  So farms are a long time coming.   Host: Yeah.   Stan Love:   People who study this problem professionally gain a new appreciation for the services that we get from the Earth without paying for them.  These would be very, very expensive if we had to try to reproduce them from scratch.  There was even a long-term experiment that was built and run in Arizona called Biosphere 2, and they built this gigantic greenhouse, and they seeded it with miniature biomes, like a jungle and a coral reef and an ocean and tried to re-create a miniature Earth's environment, totally sealed from the outside, and they put six people in it, and they were going to try to live there for a year or so.  And the results were not good.   Host: Really?   Stan Love:   Okay.  The bees that they had for pollinating all died immediately.  The ants and cockroaches population exploded.  The oxygen in the atmosphere began disappearing.  They had to pump in extra oxygen.   Host: Oh wow.   Stan Love:   To keep the crew from perishing.   Host: Right.   Stan Love:   Strange, horrible chemicals started showing up in the environment that were eventually traced to the body fat of the crew members, you know, from eating, you know, apples that had some pesticides or something on it.  They had this in their body fat, and they lost so much weight that those chemicals were showing up in the environment.   Host: Wow.   Stan Love:   And eventually they had to terminate the experiment, and there were many, many things that were problems with that, not just the technical, the management was difficult as well.  But look it up sometime and think about, okay I have to make a new biosphere too, and if any part of it fails I'm dead.  And, you know--   Host: It gives you a lot of appreciation for the Earth.   Stan Love:   Yes.   Host: Because the Earth does a pretty good job of keeping us alive.   Stan Love:   Earth does an awesome job, and we should not mess with that capability because we are highly invested in it, I like to put it, we are highly invested in the status quo.   Host: Oh yeah.   Stan Love:   So, farms and space are going to be a long time coming.  Appreciate what you got here.   [sound effect]  Host: So that's the environment, and it seems, it seems pretty straightforward, right.  You want a clean space craft, you want a fast space craft, you want one with enough food.  Now what are we doing to make sure that the astronaut’s immune system is strong?  Are there stuff, is there like exercises or something, maybe, I don't know, getting enough sleep is something that really helps with keeping the immune system strong in space.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, what you're really getting into are translational aspects of physiology that can influence the immune system.  And so exercise is important to keep the immune system strong.  If you don't exercise, you will become somewhat immune deficient, and you should exercise to maintain your immune health and other aspects of your body.  Too much exercise though, can have an adverse effect on the immune system.  Marathon runners have a higher incidence of infectious diseases after completing these races, because it's a stressor on the body.  It's like most things in life, there is a sweet spot of activity where you want to be not too much and not too little.   Host: That's right.  That's why I don't run marathons really.  I just don't want to get sick.   Dr. Brian Crucian: I've done three.  It's very challenging.  I'm a middle to the end of the pack kind of guy.   Host: Did you get sick afterwards?   Dr. Brian Crucian: No.   Host: Oh, okay.   Dr. Brian Crucian: But I wouldn't say that I was really physically exerting that much.  [laughter]   Host: Middle to the, oh, I see, I see, yeah.  So was that, is that really a consideration for space flight then, making sure that even if they are exercising, because it does help with the immune system and sleeping enough, that they're not doing so, they're not exerting themselves too much.  Is that a consideration for maintaining immune health?   Dr. Brian Crucian: That's an interesting question.  And NASA and our wonderful exercise experts here have been working this for decades.  Different types of aerobic and resistive exercise devices have been employed on ISS, and we've been looking at their effects on bone loss, muscle loss, and it's getting better is my understanding.  This is not my area of expertise, but certainly all of these exercise counter measures are having a positive effect.  Some crews don't lose that much bone and muscle as compared to early in the space program.   Host: So on top of exercise, you know, we're talking, we're talking sleeping too.  You know, we actually had a conversation, I think it was, oh, gosh, we've had a lot at this point.  I want to say it was with Tom Williams, we talked a little bit about sleep because he did a number of sleep studies, but how sleeping is, I guess, affected to the immune system, and you mentioned a little bit about circadian rhythm too, seeing 16 sunrises and sunsets per day.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Right.  Proper sleep, enough sleep is also very important for maintaining a healthy immune system, and you have a circadian rhythm that helps you sleep well at night, and so cortisol is a stress hormone, levels of cortisol will fluctuate throughout the day.  Your peak cortisol in your blood or saliva is about 30 minutes after waking.  You're up and ready to go.  It tends to trail down for the rest of the day, get you ready.  Your lowest levels are at night before sleep, get you ready for sleep, and so a proper immune system also requires sufficient sleep and also requires a well-maintained circadian rhythm.  What happens in space is they rapidly lose their circadian entrainment, and what we see is sleep medications are probably the most commonly used medication on orbit.   Host: Really?   Dr. Brian Crucian: To help the crews get a proper night sleep.  And so one of the things that is probably contributing to the dysregulation of the immune system we see on orbit is definitely a loss of circadian entrainment in these crews.  We can look at the effects of sleep loss terrestrially, either in a laboratory setting, Steven Chia [phonetic] did a nice study where he looked at the immune system of people that either didn't get enough sleep or that were shifted, one or two hours a day, over the course of a week, to look at just the effect of sleep on the immune system.  We can also look at people doing a winter over in Antarctica.  And so crews spend a year in Antarctica, they spend several months in a period of 24-hour darkness, and so that has a profound effect on their physiology, and we are, along with European collaborators, in particular Dr. Alexander Chokair [phonetic], we are looking at what happens to the immune system in several Antarctic bases.  Antarctica is a mountain, and so some of the interior bases like South Pole Station or Concordia you get these sleep alterations, the circadian loss, this 24-hour darkness, and you also have a persistent hypobaric hypoxia, coastal Antarctic winter over.   You have a normoxic environment, but you also have that extreme environment.  And so, yes, in-flight sleep is important.  It can affect the immune system, and these are the tools we would use to look at this phenomenon on the ground.   Host: Hum, Antarctica, wow.  I mean, if I was going to go to Antarctica, I'd probably choose a 24-hour light.  That would probably make me feel a little bit better.   Dr. Brian Crucian: They have that during the Antarctic summer.   Host: Yeah.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And then when we get to the Antarctic winter, they get the 24-hour darkness.   Host: Right.  I don't know why you'd sign up for the Antarctic winter trip, but how long are they staying there to really get enough data to understand this circadian change?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Crews performing a winter over in Antarctica, at most of the bases, the typical mission duration is about a year.  That makes it a fantastic ground-based space flight analog where we want a prolonged mission duration.  So the year is dictated by the calendar year.  Generally during the summer period in Antarctica, you have resupply of these bases.  Crew swaps happen, and then the last crews leave for the winter over period, and the crews do their one-year duration with the middle of the Antarctic winter being the three months or so of 24-hour darkness.   Host: Hum.  Do we have enough data to understand what's happening to the immune system because of these sleep studies, or is there still a lot that we still need to look into?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, we have been, if you're asking about Antarctica, yes, we're learning more.  People have been looking at the reactivation of latent herpes viruses, which is a nice biomarker for immune dysregulation in Antarctic winter over and during space flight for decades.  Dr. Duane Pearson at NASA was one of the pioneers for using viral DNA in saliva as a biomarker for immune dysregulation.  But more recently the studies I mentioned with our European collaborators are helping us to really define comprehensively what happens to the immune system during Antarctic winter over.  And so a lot of the same assays that we use to characterize immune changes in astronauts that have happened on ISS, we simply translate those assays to Antarctica and employ them there, and it give us a very nice flight to ground comparison.   Host: Right.   Dr. Brian Crucian: What's interesting is the different ways you have to change things to implement studies in these two different locations.  And so for space flight, it's very difficult to take our laboratory there or get a lot of crew time to do a lot of processing for the sample.  So we'll draw a blood sample.  We'll bring it back to Earth, and we can get an ambient blood sample in our hands in about 37 hours that was collected during space flight.  For Antarctic winter over, you don't have a rapid return for samples like this, and so you have to, you do have the ability to deploy a little more equipment.  And so Concordia station in particular, we deployed flow cytometers, various sample processing apparatus, and we were able to have the crews do a little more remote processing of our samples during their winter over activities.  But we're chasing the same data.  Flight to ground comparison is very important for validating a ground-based analog, which is a nice tool to help you understand what's happening during flight and also a nice location then you can probably use to test your counter measures.   Host: Right.  Yeah.  There's a lot of other, there's a lot of other research going on too that's-- you used the word analog, that's these sort of studies where you're putting them in an environment that's, you know, it's not like you're taking a vacation.  I wouldn't call that a vacation at all, but you're really just putting them in this environment to really understand what it's like in these hostile environments.  Antarctica is one of them, and there's another one called Mars 500 too.  What's happening there?  Are we doing similar studies?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Mars 500 is a very interesting space flight analog that's happening in Russia the Institute for Biomedical Problems in Moscow, and I should probably back up and give you the overview of these different types of analogs and how they work.  And so analogs on the ground are wonderful for doing physiological assessments of people and learning a little bit about space flight without having to go there, but the choice of analog depends really on the system that you're interested in.  And so if I'm interested in bone and muscle loss, we use head down tilt bedrest.  We put people in bed for 90 days, and they don't move.  Well, they move a little bit in the bed, but they don't get up.  They have this hypokinesis.  They don't use their bones and muscles as much.  They are head down tilted, so you get fluid shifts as a great analog.  It's not a great analog for immune dysregulation because a lot of the stressors I mentioned before aren't present in that analog.   Host: Right.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Antarctic winter over would not be a good analog for these bone and muscle scientists because even in Antarctica, you're in a 1G field, and you're carrying things around, and you're ambulatory and you're walking about.  And so you have this whole suite of analogs that differ.  We also have cell culture analogs and animal analogs, a whole host of tools we can use.  Mars 500 is a really nice analog where they've re-created the interior of a space vehicle, and they put people in it for up to 500 days and simulate the entire anticipated duration of a Mars mission including landing day, and then they have them exit the vehicle and do a little simulated planetary exploration in space suits, reenter the vehicle, and so to pretty high fidelity, they re-create a Mars mission and except your lacking the radiation component, the microgravity component, but most other aspects of the flight can be replicated.  They even did communication delays, I believe, to make it more realistic.   And we did have some of our European Russian collaborators do immune assessment on the Mars 500 participants and did see some interesting changes that some aspects of which did look like space flight.  And so there's probably a psychological stress component to what is happening to the immune system also.   Host: Right.  But this is, this is an analog where you don't have, you're not able to play with microgravity because this is happening in Russia.  So you're taking away some of these components that really fully encapsulate what it's like, the space flight environment basically, but you're still getting immune responses just based on being in the environment, the stress of it.  What is, what is, I guess this might be a fundamental question, but what is stressful about being in a closed environment for up to 500 days?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, you're right in that we cannot in an analog replicate all the factors associated with space flight.   Host: Right, which is why [inaudible].   Dr. Brian Crucian: When I lecture students, I tell them two things in particular.  We can't really put people in a microgravity room.  We don't have something like that, and the boards that regulate our science frown on me irradiating people.  So you're never really going to get the radiation, the microgravity component, but as you said, there are a lot of other stressors that influence people during space flight.  Those can be replicated to pretty high fidelity on the ground, the psychological aspects, the confinement, the circadian shifts, the stressors.  One of the things we prefer for immunology are in fact, these aren't really analog missions or mission simulations.  If you go to Antarctica, that's a real mission with real risk to self.  It's a dangerous place down there.  The air craft operations down there and the extreme temperatures, and so we call them space flight analogs, but in fact these are real missions to dangerous places.  So, to answer your question about what is stressful, there are different types of stress.   There are psychological stressors.  There are physiological stressors.  You being away from loved ones or being in a confined small craft is a psychological stressor.  Circadian misalignment might be a physiological stressor.  You have different mechanisms in the body, most of which are regulated by the immune system that control stress and your response to stress.  You have something called the fight or flight response.   Host: Right.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Which is you're either going to ramp up your adrenaline levels and want to engage that stressor if it's an acute stress, or if it's a chronic stress, you see changes mediated by the cortisol, which are generally immunosuppressive.  Elevated levels of cortisol are really not good.  And so space flight is a very unique stress model, we have learned through our data over the years.  It is a six-month long chronic stressor with intermittent acute stressors.  Space walks, stressful events on orbit.  Sometimes we purposefully circadian shift the crews because a vehicle is going to dock or undock.   Host: Right.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And so we don't really have a stress model like that on the ground, which is one of the reasons why the flight data that we're seeing may be so unique.  I think you asked about the flight-to-ground comparison, and yes, in some of these analogs from an immunological perspective, they look like flight, but we haven't seen one yet that looks exactly like flight.  And we look at dozens of different types of immune proteins in the blood, cytokines, and the distribution of these cells and their function.  We look at immune cell function in cell culture assays that we do.  And we haven't seen anything yet that looks exactly like flight.   Host: Well, you need to put them in the room with a gravity switch and blast them with radiation, and there you go.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, the IRB frowns on us doing that, so until then, we'll struggle using the closest analogs we can find and actually look at people during their missions, which is even better yet.   >>1Right.  So we talked a little bit about, you know, when we're talking about counter measures, just ways to prevent these, any sort of immune, I don't know, sickness, any kind of sickness when it comes to these astronauts.  There's a lot of things that you don't think of directly as counter measures, like, for example, getting a cold and taking cold medicine, but-- well maybe that's not a counter measure.  It's more of like a, I guess way to treat it.  But, yeah, what are some curious ways that we are, I guess, reducing the stress for the astronauts on board, making, I guess, just a friendlier environment.  It is a hostile environment, but as friendly as we can make it so that we're reducing their stress.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, what you're describing is a very bona fide approach to keeping astronauts healthy.  We want to reduce their stress, and so we enable them to talk to their families.  There's actually a satellite phone on board the space station, and they can call home when they need to.  We try and create work schedules that are palatable for them.  We don't want them to be working constantly and wearing themselves out.  They're working hard enough as it is, but we want to keep them healthy, and so we properly regulate their work schedules.  They're assigned psychological support folks on the ground that help get them say a TV show that they're interested in for free time or something like that, and so psychological support is very definitely something that it's happening on board ISS and something is being taken very seriously for the pending exploration missions.   Host: Right.  So it's these, these elements will be probably, I guess you can say they will be part of the exploration mission.  So if you have a long duration stay to Mars, they're going to be sending them these movies and just ways to sort of relax along the way, but then also there.  They're going to have to have some break time.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Yeah, what's interesting about considering the lunar missions or Mars missions that should happen by the 2020's, it's nice to see all that moving forward, is the vehicle design is happening now.  And so, on ISS, you're not far from home, and you have a tremendous amount of space with which to start to deploy exercise equipment, sleep compartments, carry a log of food, and these pending, these upcoming exploration missions, the situation will almost be the opposite.  You're not going to have a return option.  You're going to have a very small vehicle, and so one of the challenges I think NASA and international partner space agencies are dealing with is how to maximize the reductions in stress and the crew comfort and crew health on these missions while doing it farther from home, in a higher energy radiation environment with more stress.   Host: Yeah, yeah.  Now, thinking about missions, I guess beyond the space station, you know, now that we're kind of going towards that topic.  I'm thinking about systems really.  I'm thinking about, we're talking about a hostile environment, making the environment as I guess more comfortable, to make sure the crew is happy and healthy, which is very directly related to the immune system.  Because the happier they are, the healthier they are, you know, psychologically, physiologically, they're going to be successful on these missions.  But the systems that they're in, the closed environment that they have to be a part of, is a concern just in and of itself because right now on the space station let's just say, you know, the toilet, they have to fix the toilet a lot.  They have to fix the water recycling system a lot, and these are systems that need to be reliable for missions farther out, because you're talking about a system working as well as possible to make sure the crew is going to be healthy and happy for a three-year mission to Mars.   To Mars, on Mars, the way back from Mars.  Are these things that I guess from a human factor standpoint would be added stressors if we had to deal with maintaining systems and worrying about the reliability of these systems?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, you're making excellent points, and I agree with what you're saying, and you're, I think what you're basically saying is vehicle design for these missions beyond the Van Allen Belt is a very serious consideration.   Host: Oh, yeah.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And so we've got the ability to afford repairs on ISS if we have to.  We can make a spacewalk.  There's enough room to have spare parts for a lot of different types of equipment.  You're simply not going to have those options in the far more dangerous environment of the lunar vicinity or transitioning to Mars.   ​[sound effect]  Host: And what that really comes down to is that systems have to be super reliable.  Stan Love had some ideas on what that means for astronauts.   ​[sound effect]  Stan Love:   The difficulty of transporting things to Mars means that we can take only the minimum amount of weight and things, and that includes spare parts.  The space station right now was built, you know, of course we can send spare parts whenever we want, but the last four shuttle missions to space station carried nothing but gigantic, multi-ton palettes of spare parts that were affixed to the outside of space station, and those things are waiting.  And we've used a few of those over the years since the shuttle program was cancelled, and, you know, we can't afford to have a third of the mass of our Mars mission be spare parts.  We'll never be able to go.  So that means we have to build machines that don't break, ever.  And we're getting good at that in some areas.  Jet engines, well there was a recent thing in the headlines with an engine through a turbine blade.  The jet engines are incredibly reliable these days.  You get millions of run hours, you know, before you get a failure.  But if we could make everything on the spacecraft, especially that recycling equipment--   Host: Oh yeah.   Stan Love:   That level of reliability, but now it has to be built with extra structural margin so that it doesn't get cracks in it.  You make things thicker.  That makes them heavier.  You have to test them for decades, right, that's how long a jet engine can last, to make sure they're going to last those years.  So it becomes, you add weight, you add expense, you add development time to prove that things are that reliable.   ​[sound effect]  Dr. Brian Crucian: That's a great point, and I think what you're getting at is what if something goes wrong, either from a vehicle perspective or from a clinical perspective?  And we actually have learned quite a bit on ISS about what happens if something goes wrong from a clinical perspective.  In addition to researchers characterizing what is happening in astronauts, we also want to know if they become ill, and that is to a certain extent their confidential medical data.  That's not part of a research study, but for obvious reasons, we're interested in what is the incidence of infectious disease onboard ISS.  What happens onboard ISS clinically.  And so we have an epidemiology group at the Johnson Space Center that very kindly compiled a lot of that data for us through the first 40 or so ISS expeditions in fact.  They do have some degree of clinical incidence onboard station.  We generally haven't heard a lot about that.  It's not a tremendous amount.  It's nothing that's of a serious concern, I think, for NASA or for the public, but it's happening.   And so you have infectious diseases on board ISS.  Some rare crews have some dermatitis issues that persist during flight, and so characterizing that on ISS is a very prudent thing to do because we don't want things like that to get worse on the way to Mars.  But you mentioned the return option, and yes, we have that rapid return option onboard ISS, and we won't have that on the way to Mars.  And so we very definitely need to characterize the human system onboard ISS during orbital space flight before we put it in this smaller, more constrained vehicle and put it out into this higher energy radiation environment for say a several-years mission to another planet.   Host: That's right.  Now based on what we know, from an immunology perspective, we talked a little bit with Dr. [inaudible] again, about medication.  Do we know enough about immunology where, is there something universal that we can apply to the astronauts, maybe medication or maybe some sort of counter measure that can help prevent it, or is there a more personalized route that we really have to be considering, like a personalized medication or some kind of, I don't know, something [inaudible].  I mean not sure.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, you made a very good point before when we were talking about getting a cold, and the medications you take after that or a treatment.   Host: Yeah.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And so you can look at the med kit onboard station and parse that out into okay what are the treatments, most of it is treatments, but what are the counter measures?  And the counter measure is something that you're going to take before you get sick.   Host: Right.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And try and prevent the development of illness because you're fixing what's broken in your physiology.  And that is something that the community is still discussing, what will the counter measures be, what are the treatments.  You also mentioned personalized medicine.  And that's going to be a very important part of biomedical counter measures for space flight.  We have folks that are experts in this, Jeff Ginsberg in particular, who are starting to work with NASA and help us figure out how to take personalized medicine, precision medicine, and apply it to our unique problem, which is very healthy people in an adverse environment, and we want to keep them healthy.  And so, we may need to be screening our astronauts at some point in the future.  Do they have a predisposition to allergy or not?  We might tailor a counter measure to them or for them based on their own personal history.  If they get more infectious diseases than another crew member, we would like to know that.  There are even some biomedical tests that you can perform to look at say their predisposition to inflammation or I'm speculating perhaps their individual microbiome, which latent viruses they are seropositive for and which ones they're not.   The whole variety of things that we might consider looking at an individual astronauts as a screen prior to sending them on these exploration missions, because it would help us guide their personalized suite of counter measures.   Host: But it sounds like we sort, we already understand what we need to look for before we send someone out on a deep space mission.  You're already screening them, you're already sort of understanding their physiology and what they may need to be successful on a space flight.  Is that something that we can do, do a lot of testing beforehand and understand what we'll need for a long trip?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, the answer is yes.  We can do that.  We're not doing that yet.  We don't really have a need to do that for ISS missions.  ISS is really the adverse environment that is near to us that we can use to characterize these phenomenon, and honestly we're still learning.  Even this many years into the lifespan of ISS, we're still characterizing various biomedical phenomenon and learning.  We recently learned that astronauts have a vision issue that were generally unaware of until a few years ago, and we're learning about subtle aspects of the immune system response to space flight that we didn't know until very recently.  There are some very interesting articles that will be coming out soon.  Dr. Rickey Simpson at the University of Arizona is going to publish an article looking at the function of natural killer cells, I mentioned those before, in astronauts.  This was completely unknown before his study that in fact NK cell function is depressed in astronauts.   Host: Huh.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And that persists for a six-month mission.  And so even now we're still learning aspects of physiology that are altered that we may need to target these counter measures for.   Host: Wow.  So is there something that we can do I guess before space flight.  Like what are we doing before they even launch to really make sure that they are going to be successful, at least right now for the space station.  Is there counter measures or preparation studies that we're doing to understand this information?   Dr. Brian Crucian: So we are not really implementing specific immune countermeasures.  And in fact, our biomedical elements within the human research program are all collectively working to characterize their systems and talk about their counter measures.  You have had some successful counter measures.  Potassium citrate, Dr. Peggy Wittson was the principal investigator for a study that looked at renal stone risk onboard ISS and successfully validated using potassium citrate pills as a counter measure for that.  But generally, we're all a little less mature in our counter measures development.  And so collectively, the disciplines within the human research program are looking at this.  You're going to see more translational counter measures be discussed.  I've heard of the integrated counter measures suite, and so it's impossible to implement a counter measure for one system and not have it influence another system.  Your immune counter measures are probably going to have a positive or negative influence on bone, cardio, [inaudible] pathogen interactions, and conversely, just about any counter measure you can think someone might implement for another system, say exercise, is going to positive affect immune.   And so really you have a lot of integration in NASA's approach to looking at the problems and in the develop of the counter measures.   Host: So looking kind of forward to let's just say we have a long duration stay on the moon.  We're looking at the moon to really get more data to understand what's needed to go even further out, to have a habitat on Mars.  What are some of the interesting things if we were to have a long duration mission, say six months, maybe even a year on the moon, that can really give us insight into even missions even farther out, from an immune perspective.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, the moon is a very interesting place.   Host: Yeah.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And from an immune perspective, we really feel that the destination almost doesn't matter.  When you're beyond the Van Allen Belt and you increase the radiation and you increase the stress and you're living in constant microgravity, it doesn't matter where you go.  You're probably going to manifest the same types of immune problems from one destination to another.  Living on the moon is an interesting consideration though because you're not in pure microgravity.  Now you're in one-sixth gravity.   Host: Right.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And so I don't think anybody knows, if you look at a moving scale from zero gravity to one times the force of gravity we have here, where does the problem start.  Is half gravity enough?  Is one-sixth enough?  I don't think anybody knows.  There have been some fractional gravity bedrest studies that have been implemented, but I don't think they really were able to look at the immune system because bedrest isn't the best analog, I don't believe, for the immune system.  But it is something that folks are aware of.  There has been an artificial gravity study that NASA worked at in Galveston at the University of UTMB down there, UTMB, in Galveston, sorry.  You can stitch that together, that looked at artificial gravity as a countermeasure, and so, yeah, fractional, when you talk about the moon, you're really talking about fractional gravitational forces and what's the effect of that on physiology, and that's an area I don't think anybody has really been able to investigate.   It's very difficult to investigate that on Earth, because you're in a constant 1G field, and you just can't get away from it as much as it would be great to have that 0G room, we just don't have that.   Host: So it seems like gravity is just a consideration for a lot of different things, talking with a lot of the other experts, it's for this immune system.  It's for the crew behavioral health.  Fluid shifts.  You know, there's a lot of exercise, bone, muscle loss, a lot of things that are associated with just this lack of understanding of what happens in the one-sixth gravity environment.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Yeah.  We evolved as people in a constant 1G field, and no one had ever been out of it until the first astronauts and cosmonauts launched in the '60's, and I don't think anybody fully realized what being outside of gravity can do to your body.  And we see astronauts working very successfully and enjoying their stays onboard ISS, but if you take cells out of the body, immune cells out of the body, I can pull T cells from your blood right now, and if we put them in culture and we stimulate them and try and re-create an immune response, they literally don't work.  They don't respond.   Host: Huh.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And that is absent stress, radiation, or anything else.  Just having these cells cultured in microgravity, they don't respond.  And so investigators on the ground, NASA and external investigators have been doing flight studies of cell culture and culturing cells in ground-based apparatuses, ground-based apparatus, such as a bioreactor, which mimics microgravity culture to try and figure out why, and it appears that there are gravity-sensitive weight points in say the signal transduction pathways where the cell tells the nucleus how to respond, that are gravity sensitive.  Who would have ever thought that our cells would have a gravity-sensitive weight point within them and that they would stop working in microgravity, and yet that appears to be the case.   Host: Wow.  I don't even know what you do with that.  I mean there's not like, there's no like pill you can take.  I mean like there's a gravity pill-- yeah, that's a huge consideration.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, there's a couple things you could do.  I mean there are immune boosters, immune stimuli that might help overcome this effect to some degree.  People have considered artificial gravity as a counter measure.  Seen 2001 of Space Odyssey, if you could rotate the vehicle and get gravity back, it might help mitigate some of those effects.  But also, I mentioned that we can pull cells out of you and me, stimulate them to microgravity and they wouldn't respond.  And yet, the astronauts are very healthy on orbit.  So we don't necessarily know if that phenomenon is reproduced inside the body, because the cells in the body are not just floating in a pristine microgravity environment.  They're moving.  They're moving through the blood, and they're migrating in and out of tissues and they're looking for targets to respond to to keep you healthy.  So it's a, where we're bringing this home to is it's a very complicated consideration.  Every system is complicated.   In particular, the immune system, all these cells and the environment they have to function in and keeping them functioning properly to maintain our health, it's a complicated consideration.   Host: I think that's actually a good place to start wrapping up because this is the end of our hazards series.  This is the last episode, and the theme that I've sort of heard throughout this entire series so far is we've sectioned off each of the hazards and really gone deep into what those hazards mean, but throughout my talks the all of the experts, all of you guys, what I've really learned is that everything is connected.  You can't just look at just the immune system.  You got to think about what the gravity is doing and what the bone and muscle is doing and what, you know, how does fluid shifts go into this, going far away.  You know, everything is, everything is connected.  So, you know, one thing we talked about actually with another, Dr. Eric Antonsen, you know, we just talked to them, so it's all fresh in my mind, that particular talk, but we were talking about how all the experts are getting together and providing input.  So when you are getting together and talking about this deep space exploration, what are some of the key things that you try to, that you try to make sure that we are implementing into our future space flight plans?   Dr. Brian Crucian: So you're absolutely right, and we actually have a name for that phenomenon and what you're describing is interdisciplinary science or translational science.  And we have collectively learned that as a team over the lifespan of ISS, as the nutrition folks have, Dr. Scott Smith's lab at JSC have looked at inflammation and bone markers and nutritional status, and they have been talking to the immune team down the hall, and we've been looking at immune mediators, and we're starting to connect the dots between these systems.  We've learned what exercise can do to the immune system, what fluid shifts can do to the immune system, and what inflammation does to a variety of systems.  And so we have a name for that phenomenon, and as you so aptly put, we're working together now collectively, more than we ever have before, to address clinical risk to crew members as sort of a unified team of investigators across all of these disciplines.  You asked what we'll do about this going forward, and so you're seeing more joint solicitations for science projects or translational solicitations.   Instead of NASA or an agency looking to do a cardio study or an immune study, you're seeing broader solicitations now where the agencies that fund are encouraging investigators to look at translational aspects of their system or their findings and also interdisciplinary interpretations of data.  An immune study that was completed years ago, we now have folks pulling some of that information.  Dr. Han Lu Wu in NASA radiation is pulling some of the immune data from a study several years ago where he had radiation data.  So he's looking at say inflammation and correlating that with radiation to see if there's a relationship there.  And so the bottom line is more translational work, more interdisciplinary work, looking at these things together within our areas in JSC and also with European scientists, Canadian, Japan, Russian.  We have several very interesting studies that the Japanese Space Agency is working on, looking at [inaudible] analyses of astronauts on the International Space Station or probiotics as a counter measure.   We're very excited to see these studies mature and the data that they'll show, and it just keeps feeding more information that all of us use to help to close our clinical risks to crew members for these pending exploration missions.   Host: Collaboration is so important, but I did want to end on a more selfish note.  And that is, what are you, from your immunology perspective, looking forward to most for these deep space missions, to figure out?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, I'll answer first selfishly.  I'm looking forward to just seeing them happen.  I'm 50 now, and so I'm very excited to see people go beyond the Van Allen Belt and get to doing some real space exploration.  As a scientist, I'm looking forward to basically characterizing our system, the immune system as much as possible and start to have that dialogue about counter measures.  As I alluded to before, we've got a big suite of counter measure options for immunology.  Nutritional supplements, functional foods, probiotics, medications.  And so we plan to have discussions here within the next couple of years where we will engage flight surgeons, researchers, practicing clinical immunologists, people that are actually treating patients.  We want them to come here, see our data, and help us figure out what would be the best counter measure for astronauts on a three-year mission to Mars.  After we make that decision, then we'll have to probably spend some time looking at these counter measures, validating them in a ground analog, or hopefully onboard ISS, on ISS before the end of its lifespan so that we can have these counter measures ready for these deep space exploration missions.   Host: I'm very excited for it.  Brian, thank you so much for coming on and sharing your perspective about these hostile and closed environments, especially from the immunology perspective.  I really appreciate.   Dr. Brian Crucian: I've enjoyed it.  Thank you for having me.    [ Music ]   Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Dr. Brian Crucian about immunology and that aspect of the hostile and closed environments.  That wraps up our five hazards of human space flight podcast episodes.  You can go back and listen to previous episodes.  They're not in really any particular order, but we have associated products that go with those.  If you go to NASA.gov/hrp, there's a series of videos that are associated with each of these five hazards that are short animation videos, really give you a nice kind of overview perspective.  You can go there to watch those videos.  Otherwise, a lot of the stuff that we talked about today and a lot of our podcasts happen on the International Space Station, go to NASA.gov/ISS to find the latest there.  On social media, that's where we're looking for our questions and really answering them here on today's podcast.  On Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, you can use the #askNASA on the International Space Station or NASA Johnson Space Center accounts to ask a question or maybe submit an idea for an episode that you'd really like us to dive deep into, for Houston We Have a Podcast.  Just make sure to mention Houston We Have a Podcast.  That's how I find it.  Because there's a lot of ask NASA questions that we actually cover.   So this episode was recorded on June 28, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Pat Ryan, Bill Stafford, Bill Polaski, Judy Hayes, Isidro Reyna, Mel Whiting, and Natalie Gogins.  And thanks again to Brian Crucian for coming on the show.  To our listeners, thanks for joining us for this special series on the hazards of human space flight.  We'll be back next week with your regularly scheduled programming."}]}],"metadata":{"total_hits":51}}}
